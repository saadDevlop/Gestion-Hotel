"It was an enjoyable stay  !! Nothing to say, All was Excellent .The stuff were very helpful, the service was professional and the breakfast was tasty and varying,  guidances was given once needed I will definitely return back to the same hotel if I visit Tangier next time. ",5
"Barcelo Tanger is a great hotel! It's right next to the beach so you get a great view of the beach from the hotel. The pool is also big.  Well it is deep approximately, 1.80 meters or 2.75 meters. So if you can't swim you might need floaties or an adult with you. The rooms are very big and have very great views, my room had a big balcony with the view of the beach. The breakfast is to die for, there is so much variety of food, Sweets, Drinks, Breads, Fruits, Cereals, Omelett and even Morrocan food like Silo and many layered flat bread. The service and staff was great and very helpful. I would like mention Hajar  she was one of the staff members of the breakfast team and she was very kind and helpful, so were the other staff members. I would like to say that the manager of the breakfast team was very kind and welcoming to whoever came to breakfast. The staff at the reception was also very friendly and so was the staff at the elevators. The rooftop is very gigantic and also has a bar at the top, there is a small pool like a jacuzzi on the rooftop too. This is the Best hotel ever, You all must visit it once in your life…",5
"A very nice hotel that is in a good location.  The staff were very accommodating during my business trip.  The hotel was walking distance to the historic area of Tangier.  I would only recommend that the hotel include yoga mats, foam rollers and water station in the gym and everything would be excellent. ",4
We spent 2 nights at the hospital as we got food poisoned. I even found plastic on my meal as u can see on the picture. Our getaway became a nightmare with this dirty hotel. Staff is barely respectful,1
"Fantastic stay with the family, great location, amazing hotel service. Highly recommended for busines or Leisure. No need to use your car as everything is nearby, can't wait to plan another visit very soon.",5
"Best service from Amin Fatima Nadja. fantastic staff not good net receiver wifi ,Good location close and    nice to all the area You don't need to take a taxi, It's enough to go for a walk and Havana restaurang som de har det är jättefin man kan se hela stad läger på10 våning",5
"No friendly staff, no bar in the room, no slippers, no bath robe, no toothpaste, no room service dining, one one elevator working even if there are 3, no parking place for the car, They gave a room in the first floor with probably no beach view even if my reservation was for a room in higher floor, ",4
"Very Amazed about the new Barcelo Tanger newly opened less than a week ago! we were amazed by the quality of the product just Wow & unique in Morocco & certainly the Best in Tanger and even the whole country, super comfy, rooms are incredible very well decorated with gorgeous views over the mediteranean sea, several point of sales from the loby to all day dining at the 8th floor and a 360° rooftop at the 10th floor. Staff could not do enough for you, service over perfection, food is subtile and amazing. Just one word impressed about the high end product & quality of service & welcoming. Our new address in Tanger and will recommend to all. Special mention to the GM Ricardo to the DGM Tarik, and to our great chef the rang Taoufik at dinner and to all team members! Breakfast on the 8th flood with amazing view over the bay of Tanger was just perfection! One word just can't wait to go back!…",5
