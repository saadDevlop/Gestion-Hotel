review,rating
I highly recommend it as all the staff are friendly and helpful. The room was clean and have a good view on a huge garden. Basic breakfast but delicious. The hotel is near the tramway station and the old market.,5
"The room was clean and spacious and the staff friendly. The hotel is central, it is a 5 minute walk to the Medina. There is a little supermarket next-door, ATM's in the next road and a variety of restaurants.  Although the hotel offers a to purchase coffee service for after hours, there is a lovely coffee shop 3 doors down and they make lovely crepes.",4
"The hotel is located on the nice place near of the the downtown but the room is too small and also the tv , the remote controle doesn't work , the service is too bad , the wifi is too slow , the smells is not good then we changed the room the same things",1
The hotel was very nice and in a good location. A disadvantage of being in the city centre is the high noise level. The staff at the hotel were great and honest. The only hotel in Morocco that told me about the city tax accurately. One bad thing in the room was the bed; it made noise with every little movement.,5
"We stayed here for 1 night as part of our tour. We thought the hotel was very nice, it is a newer and the room was very clean and comfortable. We stayed in Room 707 and had a nice view overlooking the streets below us.    It was great to hear the Call to Prayer from the window as the mosque is quite close to the hotel. Bathroom and bed were of satisfactory standard and very clean.    The shower was nice and hot and had good pressure. The hotel is located in a very nice position, close to many shops, coffee places and restaurants.    We had breakfast included in our stay and was nice and had a good variety of choice. The coffee was nice and hot. The breakfast is good and clean looking out on the street.  The WIFI had good reception and the Air Con was good. Would recommend staying here if visiting Rabat.…",5
Great location only a 5/10minute walk from train station. Staff were friendly. We had a great house keeper! Room were small but good :) They held onto our luggage when we went to the near by post office the day we checked out. The front desk receptionist even found us a box!  We didnt care for the breakfast but there was a huge selection. We found a restaurant down the street that sold breakfast. There is also great cafe called art cafe near by with great food. Prefect for dinner when you want to be close to the hotel  I would recommend this hotel to everyone ,5
" Booked just for 1 night for a family of 4. Check in was straight forward and efficient and the receptionist was very helpful when I asked about local places of interest. The room was large with a modern decor. The bathroom was in excellent condition with a great shower. There was a massive king size bed, sofa bed which slept 2 and a single bed. All very comfortable. The location is great with the souk a 5 min walk and the train station also a 5 min walk in the other direction. There is a tram stop next to the cathedral a 10 min walk. Plenty of shops and cafes on your doorstep, a large park and a Mosque are immediately across the road.  Breakfast was 12 euros each, a bit expensive for a buffet but there are plenty of cafes in the area offering breakfast for 30dh per person.",5
"Clean, modern rooms and bathrooms centrally located. A short walking distance from Rabat Ville station and around the corner from the theater.  There’s the usually city noise, but the interior was quiet. Good WiFi. ",4
"Well located for a conference we were attending right across the street. Also convenient to the garden and Medina for shopping as well as great little restaurants. Staff is wonderful and tries to accommodate.  Rooms are spacious and have sound proof windows - never heard the traffic. You need to be prepared for: No heat in the rooms (we were here in November; quite uncomfortable) Breakfast is the only food from 7-11am.  No tea or snacks or anything during the day...not even water - but there is a bodega type shop open quite late next door. Refrigerator in the room; no hot pot for water. Internet is exceedingly slow.  So, you are in a beautiful city in Africa with wonderful people.  Do your homework and come with a little extra supplies.  Beware the taxis - they really don't always know the city even if you speak French.  Have the doorman instruct your driver until you know your way.  Go to Rabat - decide how much comfort you need.  We are two seniors - the cold at night was difficult, but the warmth of the staff went a long way to recovering.  ProfSusan, who travels a lot…",4
"We had 7 rooms.  Two of the women put their luggage in the room and went to dinner, but the electronic door was malfunctioning. They could not get in their room (after having spent the previous night on an airplane from the USA).  They had to go stay elsewhere without access to their belongings and retrieve them the next day.  The worst is this:  the hotel REFUSED TO REFUND THE COST OF THE ROOM.",1
"+ Clean + Helpful staff, and most of them spoke English. + Good wi-fi + Good location to the centre of town. + Room was cleaned daily.  - Breakfast was average. - No water or fridge in the room. - Single room was rather small. - If in a single room, the interconneting door to a double room was not soundproofed.",4
"Typical budget hotel. average room size for its category, but very clean. Included breakfast is basic.  Its 10 minute walk from the Train Station, close to the old Medina and many restaurants in walking distance. Staff is very helpful, and they allowed me to keep my luggage till evening after my checkout. They also arranged a taxi service for me to airport for a reasonable charge.",4
We are in a tropical tour. This has been the best hotel of the trip. Good clean decent sized rooms. Great breakfast and all within a walking distance to a fabulous restaurant.  Would definitely stay here again. ,4
"Great hotel - no problems whatsoever. Western style so nothing 'Moroccan' in particular, except the breakfast choices, which were ok, though a little simple considering the price. Felt safe and location is good.",4
"The hotel was clean and served well for a one night stop. The double bed was actually 2 single beds pushed together. Functional but you could really only sleep on the sides as the middle part was uncomfortable.  The buffet for dinner was very bland and staff offered no service. We found our own seats and found some basic food. There were no drinks offered, nor any indication we could  buy any. The terrace where it was proved to be nice location for local views with a nice sunset then sunrise the next morning. Breakfast was also bland, but much better than the evening buffet.  Our first time to Rabat and left the next morning so maybe the location is a selling point. There could be better options but was ok for a short stop. ",3
"It’s a good western stile hotel with basic comfort. We loved the shower with very hot water and there is hair dryer. A nice smell soap and shower jell.  The 1st night we were in second floor but when we came back we were on the floor and it is a bit noiser. The corner room in each floor is a family room with one big double bed, one double sofa bed and one single bed.  The breakfast seemed very nice in the first morning because we didn’t know what to expect but after one week when we returned to stay in our last night, we knew what was Moroccan breakfast and we didn’t like it very much although there was pretty much everything.  But you can have a very good breakfast with 35 dinars so why you should pay 75?  The hotel is on the other corner of a mosque so you have to be aware of…",4
"Stayed for 2 nights in this hotel. Strategic location, in the centre of the city. Walkable distance to train station and museum of art and cheap taxi fares to other places of interest. Very recommended.",5
"Very nice hotel feels very new and fresh with all modern facilities.  Great space, very good bathroom all you need for a traveler.  Check in very good and quick with friendly staff.  Only a few little things why I didn’t give 5 stars.  Wifi stopped working through the night, only 1 elevator working that can hold 3 or 4 people at most and some street noise.  Otherwise great hotel close to all the action and would star here again.",4
"Stayed for 5 nights in November and found most aspects of the hotel to be very good.  We paid a bit extra for a larger room (on the 7th floor from memory) and it's money well spent - lots of space, big comfortable bed with a spacious bathroom/shower area.  Liked the location overlooking Nouzhat Hassan Garden with easy walks to cafes/restaurants and most places of interest.  Staff on reception, housekeeping and door/parking were all friendly and helpful.  The problem area was at breakfast - lazy staff who would not replenish food or tidy up after guests had finished eating.  The other issue was the lift which at times, took an eternity to arrive.  On the morning we checked out, the lift was undergoing maintainence and couldn't be used at all but the staff kindly arranged for our…",4
"Travelodge style hotel just over 5 minutes walk from the train station and not far from the Medina by walk or tram. Quick and easy check in with efficient English speaking staff. Room access isn't via key card but by tapping a code into a keypad on the door. Breakfast overpriced, plenty of cafes within 50M of the door. Halinka over the road did a cafe au lait and croissant for 17MAD. Room had a balcony but chairs needed cleaning by me as they were dirty. Good view of Medina from room 702.",4
"I am completely pleased with my experience at the Onomo Medina.  Check-in was a breeze and our room was clean and comfortable.  There were English options on the television programming, and the bed allowed for a decent night's sleep.  The hotel is an easy walk from the train station.  There are a number of options for food and snacks within walking distance as well.  This is a safe, quiet part of the city.   We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on our next visit to Rabat.  Recommended!",4
"Its a nice hotel, functional. Our room was spacious and clean. Staff was very helpful and nice. There isnt much to do in the hotel but theres alot nearby. Air conditioning and wifi worked well. Breakfast is expensive so I didnt include it in my stay, there is a cafe right next to hotel where you can get good breakfast in reasonable price.  Also laundry service is very expensive but there is a laundry service right next to hotel which is much much cheaper.",4
"Clean and modern rooms. No keys for your room doors, just access with a passcode provided by the reception. Convenient location. Lot of cafes close-by. Close to train station. Continental breakfast option is available (but not included in the room-fare).",4
"The hotel is in a convenient location, I arrived into Rabat by train and it is around 5-10 minutes walk from the train station. The reception staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English. Just make sure you know which ONOMO hotel you are staying in as there are two in Rabat city centre (Google Maps still lists this hotel under it's former name of B&B Hotel Rabat).  The room was very modern and clean inside, easily the best room I stayed in during my time in Morocco. The air conditioning worked well, and I had a nice view of the city from my room. There was also a small fridge in the room which came in handy.  Breakfast was a little expensive, so I opted instead to eat at a cafe in the city centre. There are a number of restaurants and cafes close by.   I asked for a taxi…",5
"Wow good thing we did not finish our trip in Casablanca otherwise we would have missed a truly delightful stay in such a well laid out and scenic city, it’s just everything that Casablanca fails in, its clean, it’s friendly,it’s orderly and beautiful. The hotel adjacent to the rail way station is a gem, it’s contemporary in style, the service was great, the breakfast wonderful and to start the day from a clean and tidy roof top garden patio with great views was delightful, why even Donald Trump would say it’s great .",4
"Great service, smallish room but plenty big enough for one, great bathroom with enormous shower, very clean, small slow lift, can arrange breakfast for extra cost but plenty of patisserie close by that are cheap, very friendly and helpful staff. Central location, can walk to many attractions and also to train station.",4
"We stayed here for one night, but talked afterwards that we could have definitely stayed for longer.  The good: Good location, near the Medina and a walking distance away from many attractions and restaurants. Staff extremely politely, the ladies at the reception spoke excellent English, which is, not even in expensive hotels, a thing to take for granted. Had a very good park system, but with limited places. In front of the hotel and guided by a hotel staff member, not by a ""park guide"". Very cosy room, good air conditioning. Easily arranged a taxi to the airport (Grande Taxi, Im still very surprised at the price, 250MAD, which for a taxi is expensive, but it was our last day, and he picked us up from the front door and was on time, so I was ok with it). Easy door code system,…",5
"Very good experience,(my trip was in 2015) very nice hotel. I love the breakfast. The staff are very friendly. The rooms are very good. The hotel is very close to everything, you can visit the center on foot.",5
"We stayed in his hotel and absolutely enjoyed it! The room was nice and clean, excellent air conditioning, nice shower (with good pressure) mini fridge, strong WiFi and a decent bed. All staff were very professional and polite, room service was excellent and efficient. Location is perfect there’s a few local shops just outside for snacks, water etc, good cafes and restaurants a stones throw away. You are not too far from the medina you can walk there if you know where you going, McDonald’s near by as well as plenty of local restaurants.",5
I was wanna stay ther on May 26 and We didi not because the room was really hot. Hopefully this will help some one.  The air conditioning does not work and the hotel is not worth at all.  Find another place.  Also if you can skip Rabat is fine too. They are liars and the only time in our trip that they rippoff us.  Be aware do not stay there,1
"We booked the Twin room for a night, en route to Casablanca from Fes. The room is decent, with comfortable beds and clean toilet. It is a very basic room without amenities such as cups and water boiler. Hair dryer is available, which is a definite plus. It's a short walk to the Medina/ souk and Hassan Tower - ideal for sightseeing.",4
"Stayed there for two nights. The room was ok. Clean and basic. When we were checking out, they charged us 3 times of city tax compared to  what my reservation paper says. We were in a rush to catch an early morning train. Forgot to ask for a receipt. Of course they didn't offer that either. After coming back, I called hotels.com and asked them why the city tax was so much higher than what they listed.  It turned out the city tax was right amount, the extra was  one breakfast for one person. But none of us had breakfast there at all!! When I was asking them show me the approve, like a signature or something, they simply said they had no approve. Of course not! Because they knew they were lying. Eventually, I talked to the manager directly, he was actually the one to overcharge us…",1
"We enjoyed our 1 night stay at he hotel because it is a <10 min walk from train station, friendly staff, rooms are like 4 star western hotel rooms which was a nice break from the Dar / Riads typical of Morocco! Clean facilities. ",5
"This hotel is amazing. It is so clean, the staff are so helpful, friendly, professional, and polite.  The hotel is located in a very good place in Rabat and my room view was so good too. You can easily find a lot of restaurants, market, the tram nearby (Place Al Joulane Station/Bab Chellah station), train station and mosque next to you. You can hear the Azan from time to time for prayers, but it shouldn’t bother you if you are not Muslim since it goes on for less than 1 min.  I would love if they have coffee and kettle and some small water bottles for free.  I will gladly repeat.",4
Hello I visited B&B hotel me and my husband in March 2018 I didn’t expect it’s gonna be like that it’s is very clean hotel and the people over there very nice and kind and they smile at your face and whenever you need any help they straightaway give the help and  The hotel is located in good place and everything near you I just like it And definitely next time I’m gonna come again,4
"The proper rating should be 3.5. It should be 4.5 for its location which is almost at the doorstep/ edge of the Medina and within walking distance to most major attractions and the transport station, Rabatville train station. We are given a room that has a good view of Rabat and with comfortable, though quite small single beds. The downside is it is so spartan that there's no kettle in your room to boil water to have tea after a weary walking day, the phone doesn't work. The floor/ carpet was quite dirty when we came in, and only cleaned up the following day. But it was a trip however that was made easier by English speaking staff and their friendly smiles each day that made our stay here worthwhile. Definitely would recommend this for people travelling with no Arabic or French…",3
"Positives:  The hotel location, access to parking and level of cleanliness is very appealing.   Negatives: Since the hotel is so close to various cafes and the Rabat Medina where fresh fruit, breads, excellent coffee and tea can be had inexpensively, we did not opt for the hotel's breakfast package of 75 euros per day per person. We also learned that the coffee machine was broken so a decent cappuccino was not easy to come by.  Yet, we were charged for breakfast service and they refused to reimburse us. We left the hotel feeling less excited about it then when we arrived.  Since we return to Rabat for business and family, often, we will look for other hotels.  There are plenty.",3
"I stayed for 4 nights and I really enjoyed it. The location is excellent, in the middle of Rabat centre, very close to Rabat main train station, 7 minutes max. Beautifully located near plenty of shops, coffee shops, and the old city (medina). Rooms are of good size, beds are very comfy, elegant decorations. Try to get the rooms with a balcony to enjoy the weather and the scenery. My first remark is, only one elevator is currently working, so you tend to wait for few minutes to get it. I am told a new elevator is being installed and should be running soon. My second remark is that there are no deposit box, at least in my room, it didn’t have any. My third remark is there is no water hose by the toilet which is inconvenient. Other than that is a very good hotel.",4
"The room was nicely decorated and spacious enough. It was also clean and comfortable. Staffs were also good and helpful. Location was also nice, with good distance from all the tourist sites in town. The one mishap I had was that the rooms here use generated code to access the room, and the front desk mistakenly thought my room was not occupied, generate a code to new client who then entered my room after midnight. No harm though.",4
"Stayed here for one night, wanted a change of style as had been staying in riads.  It was a really nice surprise! Located very near the Gare Routiere, room was very modern and bathroom was great. Good wifi, breakfast good. I would recommend this place. Would have liked to stay and extra night but they were sold out.",4
The hotel is about 7 mins walk from Rabat Ville railway station and is within walking distance to most sights. My room is clean and has a good view. The hotel does not use a key but rather a password to open the room. The room is  OK and the shower is good. It has no kettle to boil hot drinking water which I personally would like. The staff are OK but inexperienced by international standards so more training would be necessary.,3
Very close to city center. Prices very reasonable but the room is small for two people. Might be ok if single. breakfast tasty and deals well with your hunger. Security checking the parking area. Will stay again. ,4
"Close to Medina , Train Station and central at a good price .Clean , good staff,  out to please .The rooms are quite , most have good views , and ideal for a stopover . Breakfast by sight looked good , a bit expensive ...we  had breakfast outside , suggest including it in the original booking. Tv in room and a mini fridge, good shower and appears to have been recently renovated ..except the carpet. English speaker at reception , assume all languages.",4
"This is one of those decent hotels who does its job. Not a memorable or traditional moroccan experience, but felt good after days of sleeping in riads.  On the negative side, there were some very loud refurbishment works going on inside the building and the breakfast was just very overpriced for what it was.",3
"The rooms were clean and hotel standard. Everything was ok. The location of the hotel is superb, nice restaurants in the area, short walk to the Medina. The breakfast was rather poor, the quality of it was ok, but there could be more choice. The staff was very friendly and also fluent in English and German.",4
- The location is surely the advantage of this hotel in the heart of the old town with many restaurants in the neighborhood. - The rooms are the cleanest in Morocco for the price. - The hotel has only one very small elevator.,3
"We arrived in Rabat on a late flight, slept, did a few hours of tourism, and then caught a taxi to Fes. This hotel was perfect for our needs. Sure, it's great to stay in a lovely riad in the medina (as we did in Fes) but that's not very practical when you arrive late at night and leave the next day. There's nothing special about the B&B Medina, but the 24-hour staff is multilingual and friendly, the location is convenient (in the new town but 10 minute walk to the medina), our room was clean and functional, and the breakfast buffet pretty decent. The only warning I'd make is that it's a bit noisy. We could hear traffic all night. Not enough to stop me sleeping, but there was noise.   The free wi-fi worked well .",4
"It is a small hotel with only the basic requirements.  The best thing is the location as it is in the city center and near to everything: main train station, the Medina, lots of restaurants around. The strange thing dough is the restaurant to take the breakfast. It is located in the lobby, left side is the reception and on Roth side, taking probably 70% of the space is were you take the breakfast. The room was big and clean.",4
"B&B Rabat Mèdina, it is an average hotel with an average price. Close to the train it's 5-6 minutes walking distance from the station of 'rabat ville'. The area is not so magical and close by there is a mosque that call 5 times a day for prayer which in the morning can be instance. Checking in you need to fill the police form like any hotel in morocco and before you leave they charge you city tax. The receptionist was ok not super friendly just ok. The elevator is super small and the staff members are using it too so it can be a while sometimes to move from one floor to another especially with suitcases. Bed comforts is average. In our room the A/C was broken they send someone to fix he just came and said wait a little but nothing happened, we were so tired from our flight so we…",2
"I spent here only 5 hours between very late arrival and early morning flight so cannot see much of the things.   Location is a downtown across the street to Medina. Spacious room, good bath and toiletries. AC works perfectly. Fridge is there but empty. Breakfast is at extra cost.   Friendly stuff at reception -- they helped me with medicine after a terrible headache! ",4
"If you come for a few days to Rabat, the location is perfect. You can go walking almost everywhere, you are near medina and all the monuments are close by. The breakfast is not so good, you can find many cafes around the hotel a lot cheaper. The receptionist wasnt really helpful when we needed a taxi. Overall it was good!",4
"First the good. The front desk staff is excellent, especially the young ladies, they are a credit to the business. Friendly, polite, helpfull and very competent. Housekeeping is also good, since the hotel is very clean and fresh everywhere.  The locations is also very good, within easy walking distance of almost everything. The wi fi works really well. Then the not so good. The worst is that there is only one very small elevator, to a fairly large hotel, and it is also used by the housekeeping staff. This emphazises the notion that the management is squeezing everything possible out of the property, by not putting in a service elevator, for housekeeping and maintenance staff, to make more space available for more bedrooms. Some of the rooms are quite dreadful. Upon arrival, i…",3
"The location couldn't be more central (it's about five minutes' walk from the central railway station), with good Wifi connection and lovely staff. There were a few minor things that could have been better – the coffee, for example! (Although as you're surrounded by cafes, it's not really a problem.) There's also nowhere in the bathroom to hang towels to dry, and hairdryers aren't available as a default, but the room was spotlessly clean & the staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. (A special thanks to Nasin - hope I've spelt his name right! - on this front.)  The only reason I marked the sleep quality down is because the hotel's right next to a mosque so you'll probably hear the morning call to prayer – which might influence some people, although I liked it!",4
"This hotel is my go-to when in Rabat, it is very close to the medina and everything I remember from my childhood. The rooms are actually pretty spacious and very modern. It reminds me of Japanese hotels, it's very compact but clean and very modern (which is a welcome break from Riads and retro-funky Riads). Breakfast is plentiful and basic. I recommend going to the medina for breakfast and just go through the main gate, to the mosque, the women selling mloui and rghaif are on the left as soon as you walk in. I LOVE RABAT.",5
"Special thanks and compliments to Kauthar and Iman, the two girls at the reception. They provided us with all the information and support we needed and made a stay at the hotel a nice experience. We will returt to the same hotel if we visit the town again.",4
"-The worst Hotel i ve ever stayed in. -Very small Bed which caused me to fall down many times, i didn't sleep at all. -Room on the main avenue, very nooisy  -No drinks in the minibar at all -if you wanna take shower, you have to sit down, which i not a good position to take shower, (BWY i didn't take any shower because of that), then a there is no -separation between toilet and shower, the water goes everywhere in the bathroom, you get invaded by the water -Too many lights in the room when you switch off the light to sleep, many blue and green lights come from TV and other devices, no sleeping possible.  -Staff Not really friendly, no help, i asked for bars in the nearby they didn't care.  Only 2 + Point: Clean and location.",1
"Very nice hotel, clean, v. good breakfast, close to everything and above all, great and informative staff.  5 to 10 minutes walk to reach the old souk where you will enjoy hours of walking, shopping and eating traditional food",4
Spend a night in Rabat. Hotel room was big but not comfortable as the ac was not working. Called front desk several times but no one was able to assist. We didn't have a choice to move to another room as the hotel 'didn't have another four sleeper'. Quite disappointing. Bathroom was big and well maintained. Staff were friendly. Hotel is situated in a busy area. Lots of shops and restaurants available. ,3
"Location is surely the advantage of this hotel, just less than a km away from Rabat medina, in a heart of old town, with many restaurants and cafes in the neigborhood. However the hotel is far from meeting the expectations. Very poorly equiped, you dont get a kettle or even a hair dryer (which should be a must). The air con was not working, the window could not be open. Poor selection for the breakfest offered. Although the room was fairly clean, it did not make for the better rate.",2
"Great location. Near a garden and medina, you can easily walk to many places. Nice breakfast, good price. Friendly staff. Great wifi. Modern/clean/safe. Nice for business trips and less touristic travel.",5
"This hotel was clean, and the staff was helpful when I arrived. Really cozy rooms. I had some problems with sleep, because of the noise outside. You can literally hear everything that is going on outside.  When I arrived the staff told me to park outside the hotel, but the next morning they called me 8 in the morning to tell me that I have to run outside and drive my car somewhere else to park, because they obviously dont own that parkingspot. So I was 5 minutes away from having my car towed away. Not a good way to wake up after not sleeping much because of the noise. Loved the room, and the inside of the hotel, but I will not be back here.",3
"This modern hotel is perfectly located close to the Medina, it's clean, safe and breakfast is really good. The service is good, whenever I needed anything they were there to assist me.  Beds are very comfortable and sleep quality is really good, just make sure to have your windows closed if you don't want to be awaken because of the call to prayer.  The only con about this place is the really small elevator, if you're claustrophobic you may better want to take the stairs instead.",5
"the rooms are small relatively, the bathroom is can yet small. I had a bug over my bed before sleeping and requested to change the mattress but of course nothing happened, just the beddings have been changed. the staff are nice but the rooms were the only thing disappointing. overall is a modernized clean lobby set hotel. convenient location around walking place, Macdonald's is just on the corner. and taxis are easily got from out there. I have never knew that using the business center to print papers is a paid service in which again i paid around 100 Dirhams for printing out papers. its easily reached hotel. I would recommend for short business visits as the price is very convenient and location. Yet again, do not waste your money for breakfast go to any restaurant for grabbing…",3
Worst ever experience. Terrible noisy area with air condition was not working. I could not sleep & had not even a single apology from receptionist. Not worth a money. Better to book something else if you need a good night sleep.,1
"We stayed the first night of our tour of Morocco and then three nights at the end.This is a modern 8 story hotel near Rue Mohammed V and the main market in a pleasant neighbourhood.  The room had a balcony facing a mosque, a small fridge, a desk, king size bed, a closet and nice washroom with shower. The rooms are clean and modern and slightly small by North American standards.  Fajr seemed to be about 5:15 when we were there so unless you enjoy an early wake up call from the muezzin bring ear plugs.  Our first night there was uneventful. When we returned two weeks later we had a bit of a problem. When we arrived the air conditioning did not work and there was no toilet paper. A call to the front desk did not work. It turns out the elevator was being serviced.  For the next two…",3
"This is a highly functional hotel. The breakfasts cost around 7.5 euros and are generally okay, but I would recommend the small eatery next to the hotel - La Ruch for a superb and affordable breakfast. B&B is conveniently located, close to the train station and central to the all the historic sights to visit. The staff are very friendly.",3
"We strayed here as stop over for two nights then again for one night on our way back from fez. Its near the beach, medina, mosques, gardens, mcdonalds and the palace! The hotel is clean, breakfast was yum service was excellent and the food on menu was well priced would definitely recommend!",5
"Great location.  Very clean and comfortable room.  Breakfast included was excellent.  Staff very professional, courteous and friendly.  Near some good restaurants.  WiFi in room was very good.  Small balcony gave beautiful view of city, ocean.  5 minute drive from the Mohammed V mausoleum.  Overall an enjoyable stay, eventhough only for one night.",5
Very basic and a little over priced but expected in Rabat. Had to use this hotel for one night as I had an early flight. Did not use the breakfast and no restaurant in the hotel. Rooms basic but clean.,3
This hotel is very centrally located with a great staff and good breakfast.   We arrived walking 15min from the train station left our stuff at the hotel and walked to the medina and from there to the Mausoleum of Mohammed V and back to the hotel all in the same day.   Would stay again. ,5
"This hotel is very well located, staff is very kind, and the breakfast is excellent; we spent 4 days in there, and everything was perfect, no problem at all. We really recommend it, is not expensive considering the services. Thanks to all the staff from Spain!",4
"I stayed here for a night before flying home.  Location is very convenient, 5-10 min walk to the old city. Lots of restaurants, cafe's nearby. Room is compact but good for a few nights stay. Very modern feel, would compare it to any small chain European hotel. A big plus is the WIFI connection.   There is only one small lift in the hotel, so you might need to wait to get your turn. ",3
"This hotel is in a perfect location to explore all sights of the medina and has all modern cons of a city hotel which were welcomed after stays without perfect hot water and heating... It's very close to a great patisserie by the park, and other restaurants in the area, and walking distance to the train station so it was perfect for us!",4
"The hotel is very good located short walking distance from medina. The room was ok, clean and comfortable. The staff was polite at check in and check out. Unfortunately the breakfast was very disappointing. Free and secure parking just in front of the hotel. The was no hairdryer in the room.",3
"Helpful reception staff, clean tidy, good bed, great breakfast, quiet, good view from room & good Wi-Fi in room.  Only concern was shower base very slippery needed to put towel down. Also charged a little more than was quoted but thought it was worth it.",4
"I stayed here for only two nights and was not paying for myself, though as far as I can see the hotel is pretty good value for money.  The room I had wasn't huge but was perfectly adequate, with a comfortable bed and good shower room, though the (squeezy) soap for the washbasin was empty all the time I was there.  The aircon was not working when I arrived but was fixed efficiently enough. There is only one (small) lift which is a little odd but this didn't cause me any great problems.  The breakfast wasn't luxurious but was perfectly adequate. Bottles of water are not provided automatically, which I think is a bit naughty, but I was given one when I asked, though I had to pay for it (25 dirhams equivalent to about £2) when I left. Close to the hotel (just behind the nearby…",3
"Thank you Dear Khalid CHIGRI for your hospitality and your kindness during all my stays in Rabat, I really feel home.  I recommend this hotel for both holidays and business... 💐😊 It's location in the city centre you will never feel bored after a hard working day, all is near by . ... :-)",5
" We arrived in Rabat at the start of a heatwave. A major gripe was that we were part of a large group and that we plus our two siblings and their spouses  were housed on 3 different floors. We were allocated a first floor room which was tiny and quite claustrophobic.  Its small window looked out on an ugly dingy area which looked like a lift shaft and made the room even more uncomfortable.  Fortunately, Imane, the helpful receptionist was able to relocate us to another very comfortable room the following day.   The hotel is very centrally located within walking distance to the Medina and close to the tramline. Everything was clean, breakfast was the regular Moroccan fare and the staff was helpful and friendly.  Wifi reception was excellent. All in all a nice place to stay.",3
"This hotel operates a predatory scheme by adding a 3% foreign currency conversion fee automatically to your bill, under the guise of helping you by “charging you in your own currency.” The front desk employee did this despite my insisting he charge me in local currency. I wrote to the hotel manager and even the president of the chain in France. The manager admitted his hotel has this policy, but insisted he was doing me a favor because otherwise my credit card company would have charged me even more! This is insulting and false — as a regular traveler I have made the effort to obtain a credit card with no foreign fee. When I asked the manager and president again to refund me the $90 fee they improperly charged me, there was only silence. This lost money had been raised by my non…",1
"Very good hotel. Room where very clean and staff where very friendly. Breakfast was very good.  The only négative point is that the hotel have only one elevator. Sometime, you have to wait a few minutes to get at your room. Location is very good and if you are lucky you can get a free parking just in front of the hotel. There is a security guard 24/24 in the hotel.  ",4
"Couldn't ask for a better hotel. Quiet, beautifully decorated and perfectly located. I stayed at this hotel many many times. Staff very friendly and helpful, check-in process fast and efficient. Room quite comfortable, no issues with bed, lighting, bathroom, or any feature. Extremely convenient location. The GM is always on site and very attentive. I highly recommend it.",5
It's very clean but the breakfast wasn't very good and the staff were annoying they came many times to the room the location was nit good because it's close to the old city   The internet wad disconnected frequently ,3
"It is a centrally located average hotel near Rabat's Medina I liked: the location, the room was so and so, relatively clean and was not very small I disliked: not having restaurant, the noise from the surrounding environment, the style from some of the night staff  Breakfast was mediocre and if you are staying several days, deadly boring.",3
"I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. The only negative comments I read about was the lack of parking spaces which to be fair, it can be difficult to find a spot at the front of the hotel however, there are plenty of spaces round the back which I think are pay and display spots.  The hotel is about a 5-10 drive from the Airport which cost me 250 Dirhams which I think was a bit much but it was late and I was really tired to haggle with the taxi drivers. I arrived at reception to be greeted by helpful staff. Initially I booked a twin room with 2 single beds but as my friend missed his flight, I was given a room with a double bed. The room has number keypad access control to the door instead of cards which is a nice touch. The room and bathroom were nice…",5
Stayed here 2 nights. Very convenient location near centre with parking space in front of the hotel. Rooms are comfy and shower is just to die for. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but there are tons of cafes and restaurants in the same block where you can grab some breakfast or lunch. I would go there again when in Rabat. ,5
"nice cleen room, room size ok, windows are excellent proitection against the street noise, good breakfast (we decided to pay this extra charge, that was worth it), friendly people. I had not even the problems, other guests reported, with parking",5
"The rooms are the cleanest in Morocco for the price.  It has seemingly brand new facilities and comfortable beds.  The location is great, within walking distance of everything you would want to see in Rabat.  The only downside is that breakfast is NOT included at this ""B&B"".",5
"The ""B&B"" is not really a B&B, but a regular hotel.  As a hotel it is fine, rooms are clean and good; breakfast is available in the lobby at an extra price.  Parking is very limited, on the street in front of the hotel, when a spot is open.  We had no problem, but clearly there could be a problem.  The location is just a couple blocks from the Medina, so any parking at all is a bit of a surprise.",3
"Overall, great hotel, not so good english from the staff, and terrible parking experience.  They have very few spaces for guests to park and they are all taken most of the time. there is public parking space outside but u have to pay a ticket during certain hours, also there is a guys at the street begging for money to watch your car, some people from the hotel say he works for them, some people say he doesn't.   Receptionists aren't able to explain you how  the hole parking thing works, mostly cause their english is not so good. While I was understanding the system and got to find the machine for the public parking ticket, i was fined by an official officer, the unofficial didn't do anything to stop it.",5
"Really friendly receptionist esp Halima. Our stay have been a comfy one. Making sure we are all good & well taken care off. It's a very modern with keyless door ( code required ) nice settings and love the bathroom 😊. Walking distance to the old medina where you can do your shopping for leather bags, Moroccan shirts, you get the idea 😊. Would come back & stay here again if I am coming back for a visit. Just awesome!",5
"I didn't expect my stay at this hotel to be such a good experience. My friends and I took the triple room. It was very clean and modern. I especially enjoyed the shower and unlike the other hotels we've been staying at, the water pressure was strong and had a constant supply of hot water. The receptionist Halima was kind enough to arrange transport to the airport (which arrived 30 minutes early) and allowed us to check out later knowing we had an evening flight. The hotel is also located a stone's throw away from the medina and there are plenty of food outlets around it making it super convenient. At night when I had to smoke outside, I was accompanied by security as a precaution. For all the above value, I'd highly recommend this hotel.",5
My girlfriend and I needed to book a room in Rabat for one night because we had an appointment early the next morning to get visas for India. I was exhausted after traveling overnight and allay from Almería Spain. When we showed up at the hotel around midnight they charged us more money than we were quoted on our internet booking site and they also charged us $6 for a bottle of water. The room was OK and the some of the staff seemed a little bit friendly the next morning. We were able to leave our bag at the hotel (which is only a few blocks from the train station) and were pleased when there were no problems picking up our bags before our afternoon train journey. The room was not that clean or properly finished (missing baseboards and poorly painted) and the people seemed to be…,2
"Staff were very friendly and pleasant, though it was interesting to see besuited managers lording it around and ignoring their customers.   This is a simple B&B offering with a basic but good buffet breakfast. Breakfast coffee is instant, dressed us as espresso. Real espresso is to be had, though staff seem reluctant to serve it. A small extra is charged.  The downtown location and proximity to the Medina is convenient for the city. Rooms are basic, modern and comfortable. Internet access is patchy, and only reliable in the lobby area. Many tv channels fail to deliver because of weak electronic connections.   Overall an OK, if rather bland and characterless place for a night or two.",3
"I spent two days only at the Medina hotel, and  to be honest, it's not what I expected. It's more likely that you will feel quite isolated. There are very good attractions which have traditional moroccan flavour all over the place in Rabat, come into this hotel (a literal B&B in British standards) and you will feel that the hotel administratoin are trying so hard to take you into Europe.  what's the POINT?!! .. I went to Morocco, not to France!!  I would have liked a traditional look and feel, as I am sick of the stiff upper lips of Europe, and wanted to enjoy a bit of Arabic style of life.  The location is fine, but then anywhere in Rabat is fine too! unless you go to the 'posh' spots of Rabat where you're living in a ghost city, all flats belong to locals who have bought them…",3
"Close to the train station and tram. Clean, new and contemporary decoration. Staff not very friendly. We paid the tourist tax in cash and they wouldn't give us the return. Recommended for tourists and business. Good buffet breakfast. Mosque in front. Free internet service.",4
"The rooms are clean. The staff are ok but they do not go out of their way to be friendly or helpful. We had a problem that our travel agent had not settled our bill. HE had sent the card details but not the cvv number. The hotel did not bother to chase this up but just decided to land us with the bill. I ended up having to sort the mess out myself by getting our travel agent to get in touch with the hotel and sort things out. On the plus side they didn't make us pay there and then to get room access though they did take our passports hostage. A bit more initiative from the hotel would have been appreciated. The wifi is free and fast. The hotel is located in a nice spot, my room had a great view over the park. I will give it another try soon.",4
"I did not have high expectations, and yet the staff were quite friendly, and I found the room clean, and the breakfast adequate.  In future, I would probably choose some place less sterile, with more atmosphere, especially being in Morocco.",3
"The hotel has a good location and it´s practical if all you need from a hotel is just to sleep at night. The room is nice although a bit small. the air condition didn´t work and when we asked to be repaired, the technician came immediately and tried to solve the problem in vain, but he told us that it´s working. When we couldn´t breath and called again and asked to change the room or repair it, the technician came again and made it clear, it´s this way or open the window, which we did :-) .. If you are late for an appointment, don´t use the elevator because you will lose so much time waiting for it.",2
