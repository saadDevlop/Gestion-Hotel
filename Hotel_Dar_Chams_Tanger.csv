"We had two wonderful nights in Dar Chams Tanja upon arriving in Tangier. Noura at the reception made sure we were comfortable and well taken care of at all times, helping us to plan everything from renting a scooter, ordering taxis, arranging for wonderful hammam, restaurants and more. Noura even helped us prepare for our further journey around Morocco by suggesting places to stay and activities to do in other towns. It is rare to meet such dedicated and personally invested staff. All in all we had the best possible stay at the beautiful Dar Chams Tanja and cannot recommend it enough.",5
"Boutique hotel!  each room has its own story. A guest house with a local flavor: hamam, excellent location, delicious breakfast, a wonderful a la carte restaurant for dinner. Nora is 24/7 support! many thanks to the owner - modern, but Morocco is felt in everything...",5
"This is a beautiful guest house with so many little areas to relax.  Breakfast was wonderful on the roof top deck with an unobstructed view of the Atlantic Ocean.   Beds are comfy and the hottest shower i had in Morocco. ( 18 days). Rooms are very spacious, ( we had 2 sitting areas)  Staff is wonderful .Zoubair even  found us some rose wine and chips to top off our evening.   If you are vising tangier, I strongly recommend you stay at  Dar chams, you will not regret it.   ",5
"We spent a wonderful time in a wonderful place. The best we have seen in Tangier, the breakfast is just amazing and the staff so kind and helpful.  Yousra, Simo and Ismail were so nice and super available, gave us great recommendations in Tangier, and we really felt at home.  I will definitely come back and recommend this place to everyone.  Thank you for this amazing experience!  See you soon!",5
"Professionally perfect family-fun riad hotel. Everything was just right, from the location to the room design and facilities. The most enjoyable aspect was the service level and attitude of the owners. Thank you Yousra, for a wonderful experience. We should have stayed longer. ",5
Amazing riad — a 5 star experience. The room was absolutely perfect and the breakfast was delicious. The rooms had all the toiletries and slippers to walk around. The owners and manager were extremely helpful and made sure I was comfortable and happy. Definitely returning and booking again,5
"Fantastic central location . We were welcomed by the lovely French owner , who offered us the traditional mint tea whilst explaining to us how to navigate around the local area and provided us a map. She recommended restaurants and booked the Hammam for myself . We booked 2 rooms which were both incredibly spacious , and a fantastic rain shower. Breakfast was a real delight ! Fresh fruits , feta and warm breads . My daughter had a fresh omelette with hot chocolate .  Can not recommend this place highly enough . Welcoming , clean and traditional . Looking forward to returning.",5
"We were very happy with this lodging choice. The Dar is fully renovated and elegantly decorated. It reminds of a modern Andalusian style with a touch of French elegance. The whole dar was meticulously clean and the owners  are very hospitable and kind people. The breakfast is extremely satisfying and tasty, particularly the Morrocan pancakes and the marmelades. The dar is strategically located minutes from the Medina center near the Kazba. We had a junior suite, which was very comfortable and beautifully decorated. We would definitely return to this dar, if we travelled back to Tangier!",5
My daughter and I enjoyed 4 wonderful days in Tangier and stayed at  Dar Chams Tanjia. The staff were helpful and always on hand. We enjoyed a hearty breakfast on the roof terrace each morning before exploring amazing Tangier. There is so much to see and we recommend staying at Dar Chams for a relaxing experience.,5
"If you enjoy the hustle and bustle of the Medina, this is the place for you. Turns out my husband doesn’t so need to have a different travel companion next time I head to an unsanitised resort! He finds the environment totally intimidating which it probably is to quite a few people. However the staff at this lovely place couldn’t be nicer and more welcoming. Sadly stranded here as no crossings back to Tarifa due to high winds. So heading to the Hilton followed by flight to Gibraltar.... so adventure continues!",5
"This is a very nice riad. The rooms were very nice sand the breakfast is excellent. Location is within the Kasbah, not the easiest to reach by car. Short walk to the petit socco and a bit further to the grand socco. The place is not cheap, but would definitely stay again if in Tangier.",5
"We found everything perfect in the very precise French way that Michelle ran the B&B. The welcome with tea and biscuits was charming, the room and common areas were beautifully decorated in the old Moroccan way and breakfast was full and perfectly cooked and served on the marvellous on the terrace overlooking the city. Madame had booked a walking tour of the old city and a day trip to Chefchaoun for us that added to our Moroccan experience. The prices are not cheap, but are thoroughly worth it. It was one of the high points in our 30 days in Spain and Morocco. You should stay at Dar Chams. ",5
"Charming Riad located in the Medina, within walking distance to souqs, restaurants etc.… you couldn’t ask for a better location!   Vehicles are not able to drop you at the front door of the Riad and therefore park about a half a block away. It’s a bit of a steep descent from the car park to the Riad with many stairs. The taxi drivers will help carry your luggage however if you have mobility issues this may be a challenge. The owner emailed us prior to our trip offering to arrange taxi service for us which we took them up on. The driver was waiting for us at the airport.  The Riad is beautiful inside with lots of mosaic tile and Moroccan charm. Michelle gave us a very warm welcome. She checked us in while we chatted and enjoyed mint tea and cookies.  There is no elevator in the…",5
"We loved our stay at Dar Chams Tanja!  It was recommended to us by our tour guide, and we were very happy with it!  It is a gorgeous property in a perfect, central area of town.  The included breakfast was delicious!  If we are ever back in Tangier, we would certainly stay here again!",5
The room is quite comfortable though the bathroom is not the greatest. Our room was right over the street and it was noisy until 2:00 a.m. which is not the greatest if you are a light sleeper. We had barely checked in when our hostess told us that our room had not been paid for. So we were a little concerned since we were just starting our ten day tour of Morocco. Any way the snafu did get sorted out but I must say it put a damper on how we viewed our hostess and hence I was not too enthused about this place. I am sure there are better places to stay in Tangier. At my most generous I would say that this place is a 3 star. The access is not very good. It's a downhill walk from the area where we were parked.,3
"Dominic and Michelle were very welcoming and we enjoyed our stay here!  While we only had one full day in Tangier, we were given a great recommendation to do a taxi tour of the city.  While this might not sound great at first glance, there is SO much more in Tangier than the old Medina and the legation building.  The service and staff is top notch, breakfast was perfect, and the detail in the room is impeccable.  The riad is extremely close to the taxi drop-off point for the Medina, I believe it is the closest riad from the parking lot at the top of the hill.  The local kids that hang out in the Medina were kind and pointed us in the right direction when we got to the bottom of the stairs (unlike in other cities where they purposely send you in the wrong direction).  Michelle…",5
Exceeded our expectation Staff superb nothing to much trouble The recommendations made by Michelle made our short 3day break unforgettable and wanting more .Breakfast on the roof is a must and sets you up for the whole day :The setting of the guest house and views are truly what you go to Tangier for we were made to feel like one of the family Thank you all,5
"The rooms are decorative, fancy with ethnic decor, with the necessities and some frills.That said, the 500 yards of steps down cobblestone hills and also inside to rooms are daunting for seniors or others with mobility issues.  Very refreshing breakfast on the rooftop, still another difficult climb for seniors. Sadly the fatigue of negotiating the steps spoiled the  appreciation somewhat.. You'll have to have a porter for your luggage. Suggest travel light.",2
"Dar Chams is a lovely converted Dar in the Medina of Tangier.  The french owners are wonderful hosts and bring a warm feeling to the property.  Our room was very nice and breakfast was delicious.  Hint: As with most converted small properties in medinas, use care to fully research if you have mobility issues.  Cars cannot reach the property and must stop a few blocks away so there is a bit of a walk to the property with luggage.  Also, walking steps is a must.  If those aren't issues for you it's a great place to stay.",5
"Forget the big hotels near the station, venture into the old town and get a taste of the real Tangier. Michelle, your host, will look after you so well you won’t want to leave. Rooms are beautifully finished and there is a wonderful rooftop area for views and breakfast. It really is a magical place.  We also had Michelle organise a day trip to Chefchaouen by grand taxi.....expensive, but a real highlight.  PS make sure you get Michelle to order the petite taxi for you from the station so you don’t get any problems.",5
"It is not surprising that this converted riad is so highly rated. The rooms, like the public area, are decorated with taste; the breakfasts are delicious; and the owners, Michelle and Dominique, are the perfect hosts. Dar Chams is tucked within the medina, not far from the kasbah (don’t miss the museum there). I would gladly return to this delightful place. ",5
"Our 1st four-poster bed of the trip in a very nice room.  Large shower and two-sink vanity.  A/C available, but not necessary.  We couldn’t figure out the TV and the lady/owner was no help.  Otherwise a fine room.  Don’t book this hotel unless you can climb stairs, as there’s no elevator.  It’s 70-odd steps from the lobby to the roof if you’re having breakfast and the climb is worth every step.  Beautiful setting and view from the roof dining area.  Take a taxi to the hotel unless you love dragging your luggage up incredibly steep and endless hills.  Upon checkin, the owner offers tea and, unless you want to be considered a barbarian, accept it.  You can get glasses of wine and either sit in the ground floor area or have them taken to your room.  Staff and owners super polite…",5
"The owners live there and were just a wonderful, helpful married French couple.  Our room was absolutely outstanding and my wife fell in love with the shower.  We had a corner room named ""Soussias"" and we could open the windows.  We procured the hotel's single floor fan as soon as we arrived so we could ensure air circulation in the room.  The air conditioning had some difficulty so we were grateful to have the fan.  While there the owners arranged for a massage for both of us.  Breakfast each morning was enjoyable on the roof of the hotel.  The only drawback was the location, in the depth of the medina - hundreds of narrow alleyways that are their streets.",5
Great location in the middle of the Medina close to the Kasbah and many other sites Wonderful people always with a smile Amazing breakfast on the terrace with a spectacular view of Tanger Beautiful design,5
"Due to a plumbing issue we had to switch hotels.  At first we were disappointed, but that changed upon our arrival.  Everything was lovely!  Breakfast on the rooftop was a highlight, but mint tea with the owner at check in was a great touch.  So glad we accidentally found it!",5
"Absolutely delightful small Riad in an excellent location inside the Medina in Tangier. Easy to walk to restaurants (there are many nearby), to the medina shops, and to many other sites. The rooms were lovely and a good size. The rooftop deck has a great view and breakfast was served there each morning. Breakfast was delightful - the fresh squeezed orange in all of Morroco is delicious and olives are served at all meals. The breads, dates, jams,and pastries were yummy too. If you are going to Tangier look up some fun facts about the socialite Barbara Hutton who lived there in the 60s - her home is beside the hotel.  A huge thank you to French owners  Michele and Dominic. They were most helpful and always there when you needed them. Their staff was helpful to and although the…",5
We stayed one night in Tangier at Hotel Dar Chams Tanja.  The hotel is located near the former palace in the heart of the Médina.  This is a terrific hotel.  We booked a junior suite.  The room included a king bed and was well decorated with original art pieces.  Breakfast was served on the terrace that provides a 360 degree view of the city.  The food was terrific.  Dominique (hotel owner/manager) made arrangements for a cab to pick us up from the ferry to bring us to the hotel when we arrived.  He also arranged for a private tour guide that made the trip a tremendous success.  Ask for Youssaf - he was outstanding.  This place is a 9.8 / 10 for me.,5
"This property will get mixed reviews.  First of all, it’s in the best and worst location.  Located just downhill from the Kasbah where the views are very nice and the property itself is aesthetically charming you will soon learn from a comfort perspective looks can be deceiving.  To say it was noisy would be an understatement as the area directly outside of the hotel appeared to be a gathering place for teenagers and carousers who were noisy every night into the morning hours.  The sounds of wheeled carts bouncing on the cobblestones only ceased for perhaps two hours early in the morning, then started again before the 4: AM first prayer blared from loudspeakers.  If sleep is something you treasure, you will be better off staying in one of the beach hotels.  Access to the beach…",3
"Beautiful hotel! The owners greeted us with Moroccan tea at the door. The roof has a great view of the entire city! The night staff recommended a great restaurant next door for dinner with another great view of Tangier at sunset. The breakfast the next morning was a spread of pound cakes, cheese, olives, fruit, bread and eggs. The staff was very sweet and the hotel was absolutely stunning! Would definitely stay here again. ",5
Spent two night here recently. it is a beautifully maintained old riad with some lovely artefacts. Our room was clean and well equipped as well as stylishly decorated and the host and hostess were very helpful and attentive.  The location is ideal and very close to the Medina and there is a roof top garden with amazing views across the port towards Spain and the Straits of Gibraltar. Would certainly stay here again.,5
We celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary her and wished we could stay longer. The owners are wonderful people who are most helpful. We had to catch an early flight and they made sure we had an early breakfast prepared for us. They also helped us with hotel and taxi reservations. The riad itself is lovely and in the most perfect location. A short but very sweet stay!,5
"Ideally located next to the Kasbah and the Medina and within walking distance of everything worth seeing. Run by a French couple who are always on hand for recommendations, this modern and well appointed Riad commands amazing views of old historic Tangier and has a lot of charm without being too in-your-face tradicional on the decoration. Breakfast is a delight with excellent coffee, fresh orange juice and local delicacies offered.",5
"Warm greeting by the owner and then a light chat in the parlor. We could have gone on for longer but were tired after our day of exploring the Kasbah and Medina.  Hotel feels like it's from a bygone era. The layout, the service, the amenities. Was expecting Humphrey Bogart to be in one of the parlors.  Rooms were very spacious, very well laid out, Bed was soft and comfy, shower was just lovely, a gentle rain fall from the ceiling. Wifi was strong throughout the whole building, even up on the terrace.  We enjoyed a bottle of wine on the roof top terrace, great view over the waterfront as well as the Kasbah and Medina.  We only had one night here but could very easily spend a week or more.   If you want a great addition to your experience in Tanger, this is the place!.",5
"This boutique is situated in a beautiful riad between the medina and kasbah.  Perfect for walking in any direction. Decor is extremely tasteful.  Breakfast was excellent. Our hostess, Khadijah, extended a warm and friendly greeting, accompanied by the city's famous mint tea.  She was extremely helpful to us as we planned our walking trips through the city.  Cannot imagine a better venue for your initial experience in this fascinating city.",5
"Tangier was the first place in Morocco we visited during our trip around the country in December 2018. Tangier is in our opinion not the most exiting city in Morocco, but Dar Chams Tanja is an excellent choice regardless. We stayed for two nights at and are left with only good memories. Friendly staff, fantastic bed, great bathroom and superb location.  Vegard & Carolin",5
The hotel itself is nice. The rooms are clean. The breakfast was good. The location is good but a little awkward to get to and be prepared to walk up and down hills to get anywhere. Our room looked over the street and was noisy until around midnight. The location is good if you want to experience the Médina.  Staff were friendly and efficient. Overall good but not great.,4
"Dar Chams Tanja is a beautiful property inside the Medina. The hosts, Michèle & Dominique, are warm & hospitable one feels immediately at home upon entering. The ladies who serve breakfast & clean the rooms greet guests with smiles. Bed was very comfortable, room was quiet with good quality linens and towels.  The water pressure in the shower was great!  Breakfast is an excellent assortment with good coffee. The driver they arranged for us was good.  Last but not least, Khadija, the manager, is always there to answer questions & take care of the guests. There is a lounge area on the terrasse to enjoy a panoramic view of Tangier, sunrise was specially gorgeous.  Thank you for a memorable stay.   Couldn’t have asked for a better first experience in Morocco.   ",5
Michele is a great host of this upscale bed and breakfast in the heart of the Medina: it's a dream come true. The bedrooms are decorated in local style and offer all the luxurious amenities of a 5-star hotel. I highly recommend!,5
"Some distance from the car park, and would need a cart to reach the Riad. Michelle and Dominique were very helpful. Breakfast was sumptuous, and service excellent. Rooms are tastefully decorated. 4 coaster bed, 3 basins in the bathroom. Spacious and well appointed. Comfortable stay.",5
"We spent our first and last nights at Dar Chams Tanja during our recent ten day, first time visit to Morocco.  We were exhausted upon arrival that first night. Lovely Khadijah, the Manager, greeted us and welcomed us with Hot Mint Tea.  There was such a calmness in the place, very soft peaceful music, beautiful artwork everywhere, visually interesting spaces and sitting rooms, it just felt like such a quiet, spiritual haven compared to the livliness of Tangier on the other side of the big wooden door. Our room was quite comfortable and beautifully appointed with traditional rugs, furniture, and artwork; the bed was amazing, and everything was there to make our short stay restful and memorable.  Breakfast the next morning was amazing, and the young woman who made our eggs had the…",5
"Clean, comfortable, quiet and extremely welcoming. Michèle and Dominique are perfect hosts - well informed and well connected across town, running an efficient and friendly team ready to make you feel at home. An oasis in the Medina, wonderful rooftop terraces to relax and cosy traditional rooms to retreat to, as well as a friendly atrium for lavish breakfasts and attentive but unobtrusive service at any time.",5
"We only stayed one night but wish we stayed longer! The Inn is located in the Medina and a bit challenging to find. However, once you're there, everything is within walking distance in and around the area.  The hosts and staff are wonderful and very accommodating. The host doesn't speak English very well but the manager does and we managed to get by.  The Inn is beautifully furnished, clean, and comfortable. Breakfast is a wonderful French feast (not a ""continental"" breakfast)!  Have a glass (or bottle) of wine up on the rooftop deck and enjoy the views of the city and the Straight.   This Inn is one of the best I have ever stayed in around the world and I do not give 5 dots easily. I highly recommend Dar Chams and will stay there if I am back in Tangier.",5
We had a wonderful stay here ..just one night but the Hosts Michelle and Dominique and Khatija extended such a warm  welcome. Even gave us a room on the first floor as we didnt want to climb too many stairs.  Thank you! Breakfast was lovely....and Michelle even had her breakfast with us. Would have liked to have spent more time in Tangier but had to move on. A unique experience ...and we loved this guesthouse,5
"We stayed at Dar Chams Tanja for two nights in December 2018.  We arrived from Tarifa on the FRS ferry, and Michèle, the owner of Dar Chams, arranged for a taxi to meet us.  When we arrived at the riad, I finally had the chance to meet Michèle, with whom I had been corresponding in preparation for our trip.  Michèle welcomed us with mint tea and cookies, and we had a very pleasant conversation in French (although Michèle speaks English too).  Michèle described the neighborhood, and recommended a few restaurants in the area, distinguishing between those which serve wine, and those which do not (much appreciated!!).  Our room at the riad was large and extremely comfortable.  Warm earth tones reminded us of our bedroom at home.  The rugs, artwork and furnishings were beautiful. …",5
"This was kind of a unique experience. We had double booked a hotel for the night, Dar Chams Tanja and another hotel. These things will happen when more than one person traveling is booking hotels. The hosts understood the situation very well and gave us a credit for when we are next in Tangier, which I hope is very soon. For the half hour, I was in the hotel, I took in the rich woodwork and architecture inside. It felt like I was at home. Looking forward to actually staying there.",5
"We spent one night at Dar Chams Tanja. The owners, Michelle and Dominique could not have been warmer or more helpful. With all the necessary amenities, their home (Dar) is beautiful, elegant, interesting, comfortable, has a beautiful rooftop terrace and is situated in a great location.Mint tea and homemade treats and breakfast were delicious! Dar Chams Tanja was just perfect.Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5
"This is a magnificent Riad in the true sense of the word. Located by the Kasbah and Madina it is elegantly and tastefully restored. Greeted by the friendly owner, some mint tea and cookies, you are immediately swept into a world of French elegance with Moroccan flair. The room is extremely comfortable. Although not a restaurant we had a wonderful dinner that outdid most restaurants.  I could not recommend it more highly",5
Our first night in Tangier was here and it did not disappoint! Beautifully decorated. Lovely art work. Welcome mint tea and cakes. The best breakfast we had during our trip. Served on the roof terrace with lovely views over Tangier. Would definitely stay here again.,5
"We were warmly welcomed by Dominique upon our arrival and given some delicious mint tea while we checked in. The hotel is beautifully appointed with artwork and Moroccan crafts. The breakfast was delightful up on the terrace, and Atika always greeted us with a lovely smile. Dominique was so friendly and eager to help us find our way around, giving us great advice and suggestions. The night manager was also very courteous and eager to be of help when we needed it. The location of the hotel is fabulous, right in the Kasbah area and walking distance to the sights in the medina and to the marina. My favorite part of the Dar Chams Tanja stay, besides meeting Dominique and the staff, was the charming and relaxing terrace, from which there are fabulous views of the Bay of Tangier, the…",5
"The Dar Chams is beautifully appointed, with great attention to detail which was not lost on my husband and I. The linnens were first rate the beds were soft yet firm and the water pressure in the shower was outstanding. The Owner Michele is a wonderful woman and host Kahidija is helpful and informative. Breakfasts on the rooftop terrace were delightful. The food and coffee were tasty and you will receive plenty of attention. We asked for our laundry to be washed and everything was returned in perfect condition. Michele provided us with a great recomendation of ""Mohamed  Saimo Tour +212 674842558 "" and we enjoyed a week long tour throughout Morrocco that enriched our Morroccan experience. And if that is not enough the location couldnt be better for walking to the Kasbah and…",5
"A wonderful 3 night stay at this beautiful hotel in the heart of the Medina.  Mr Dominic was the most gracious and courteous owner and he has a wonderful team of staff who could not have been more helpful.  Khadija, the manager was the most friendly, helpful and knowledgeable ambassador for both the hotel and Tangiers.  I could not speak highly enough of our stay and unequivocally recommend Dar Chams Tanja.  Many thanks and I hope to return soon.",5
"The rooms are spacious, very clean and well decorated, we were greeted by the Owner Mr Dominic & the Manager Ms. Khadija with a warm welcome feels like you are at home, a special Thanks for the ladies for the DELICIOUS breakfast and the morning smile, all the staff were friendly and professional, if you need any advise about the city or anything don't hesitate to ask Khadija she's the most helpful person i've ever met while traveling, the rooftop terrace offers a wonderful view, don't miss to take a HAMMAM you will sleep like babies.",5
This was sort of a bed and breakfast type place.  The staff was so amazing at making you feel right at home.  The breakfast in the morning was so wonderful. The breads were amazing   I loved the rooftop also ,5
"It is one of the best places to stay in Tangier. The rooms are specious, clean and well decorated. The owner and especially the manager are very helpful and friendly. They gave us a lot of useful tips about the city. We love this place and for sure we will be back:) breakfest is great and it’s served at the roof of the building with amazing views over the old town.",5
"I LOVE this boutique hotel!  Right in the heart of the old city; next to the restaurant with one of the best views of the harbor!  The upstairs deck gives a panorama view of sunrises!  Old world charm with all modern conveniences.  Great mint tea and cookies while checking in, so refreshing against the heat of the afternoon.  Very accommodating, all you needed to do was ask.  I’ve only one night, would definitely come back for a longer stay.   ",5
A welcome oasis from the hustle of Tangier.  Khadija was very helpful.  We had to leave early to catch a ferry and the night manager prepared an early breakfast for us.  All the staff were friendly and professional.  Book directly and they will provide a taxi at the city port.,5
"This hotel is extremely well located, and pure zen once you're inside. I highly recommend staying here not only because of this, but also because the staff is amazing. Khadija was the most helpful person I've ever met in a hotel. She was very informative, and assisted us in all of our travel planning to get back home.   Highly recommend staying at this property!",5
"Going to Morocco for the first time can be overwhelming. The owner and staff at Dar Charms alleviated all of our trepidation. Here you get treated like family.  They helped us arrange everything we needed; Pick-up from the ferry,Taxi rides, guides, restaurant reservations and recommendations, money exchange, etc. They saw to it that we were happy with everything about our stay.  24 hour on staff security as well and a safe in the room,  The hotel is beautiful- wonderful terrace with a fantastic view! The room was very comfortable- although there was some street noise at night. Breakfast was fabulous but enormous- they just kept on bringing out more food! Too much for 2 people! Thank you Dar Charms for making our stay in Tanger truly wonderful!",5
"We lovely our stay here. We were very late after coming by the ferry from Algerciras but the taxi arranged by the hotel was still waiting to take us to the hotel. On the way Mohammad Ali joined us and told us about Tangier which was great. After arriving we were greeted by Khadija with a lovely warm welcome,mint tea and biscuits,just what we needed. Mohammad Ali then took us for a tour of the area pointing out some interesting history,before arranging for us a traditional dinner,he did an excellent job. Then we were shown to our beautiful room, which was appointed beautifully and so nice and clean. Through out our stay all of the staff could not have been more helpful, breakfast was delicious and nothing was too much trouble. Khadija arranged tours and transport for us which we…",5
"The place is beautiful, the breakfast is good and the staff adorable. But there is a BIG problem: the owners. The husband is no longer fit to run such a business so the wife does most of the heavy lifting. She has quite a character, so if you are used to decent service, you shall get surprised.  We initially booked through Expedia, with a fully flexible rate (a requirement, as schedules move around a lot). After changing the reservation a first time, the wife contacted us, asked us the cancel the booking with Expedia, book directly with her and pay cash in euros...against a 10% discount.  We did it, VERY bad idea. What she didn't tell us is that in the process she changed the cancellation policy to a very strict one. So when our flight was moved a day earlier and we had to…",1
"Lovely property perched high above ht told Medina, run by a lovely and welcoming French couple. The hotel interior is very tastefully decorated, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the breakfast on the rooftop is a real treat. Highly recommended!",5
I stayed here my first time visiting Morocco and the atmosphere was heavenly! The hotel staff went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect and helped us navigate our trip. Lovely experience in a lovely place!,5
"A Beautiful raid at the the Médina—-near the kasbah.  The French owners Michelle and Dominic are so welcoming - their attention to detail, the service is impeccable,  and dinner and breakfast were delicious.  Don’t miss taking a Hamman- we slept like babies",5
I can say enough about how nice this hotel is.  The couple that run it are lovely and accommodating.  Their staff could not have been more helpful or pleasant.  It's very peaceful and calming in the bustling madina.  Rooms are nice size and decorated of comfort and with a Moroccan flair. Don't miss the Haman and Massages at  the hotel.  Supper fabulous breakfast too. I can say enough about this place.  FYI this is my 3d stay,5
"I stayed at Dar Chams for three nights with two friends when visiting Tangier. Everything about our experience was wonderful and was refreshing after our stay in Marrakech. We arrived early by train after a night of traveling, and were greeted with tea and cookies while we waited for our room. We were also allowed to check in early, which was so nice after a long train ride. The staff carried our bags for us to our room on the top floor, Fassia, which was a junior suite. The room was plenty big for three people, smelled wonderfully, and had a huge bathroom with carefully laid out toiletries and Dar Chams branded amenities (towels, slippers, robes). This was such a nice touch. Everything was immaculate in here.  Despite there being somewhat of a language gap, the staff at Dar…",5
"Recently renovated, attentive owners and easy to find in the maze of streets since it sits near one of three main gates to the Kasbah.  The breakfast was simple but delicious.  Elegant respite from what can be a frenetic environment.",5
"This property reflects top qualities of professionalism, charm, great team, beautiful property ideally located. This was by far the best place we stayed in Morocco and it is a tribute to the owners as to not only the most beautiful Dar but the people are so attentive and kind. Breakfasts are superb and the quality of linens and fittings are amazing.",5
"Amazing gem in old town.  Right in the heart of windy streets.  Meet with hot tea and cookies.  Enjoyed chatting with the owner.  Rooms gorgeous.  We only stayed one evening, wish we had stayed longer.   Hoping to return soon.  Complete breakfast.",5
"This is the most beautiful Dar I’ve stayed at in Morocco. Each room has its unique decor and each en suite bathroom is designed differently. The most important thing about this Dar is the service provided by the staff. Khadija is amazing on how she had everything ready for us and 5 other couples we traveled with. The owner was very welcoming as well. And I can not say more about the rooftop breakfast that was prepared for our group. This Dar is not only beautiful structurally and very very clean, the staff that’s running this Dar is more beautiful and good hearted. Can’t wait to return.",5
"Beautiful, immaculate, comfortable guest house with only 7 rooms and very spacious. Our suite was composed of 3 rooms: a bedroom, a sitting room, and spacious bathroom with large fluffy towels and all amenities. The breakfast, included, was bountiful and delicious. Khadijah provided very personalized advice about tangier and set up touring with trusted colleagues. We spent 5 hours on a fantastic walking tour with Hassan-- highly recommended!!  You could not see the city on your own in the way Hassan introduced it. Paces away from the wonderful kasbah museum",5
"Perfectly situated in the centre of The Casbah, Der Chams Tanja is a beautifully appointed hotel. The rooms are spacious & with all the trimmings (eg. thick, fluffy towels & bath robes), internet is fast and the food (for breakfast) is superb.  Best of all is that it’s managed by Khadija  She met us at the door, sat down with us in the lounge while explaining everything about the hotel services and what was on offer in the Médina outside. She even escorted us to dinner, one night as we had chosen a restaurant which was hard to find in the swirling streets of The Casbah.  Khadija went so much further than she needed to, in the process insuring that we had a fabulous time Thanks guys ",5
"Dar Champs is in excellent location, beautifully decorated and immaculate. Everything one would expect in a luxury property. However, I froze in my room as well as in the lobby as there was no heat. In the morning the hot water was lukewarm, and it was no fun taking a lukewarm shower in a cool room. The breakfast was very standard with little choice. The value we received for the money charged was low to say the least. We would never stay here again and would not recommend it to our friends either.",2
"Beautiful riad, tastefully decorated. The room was spacious and clean, and so was the bathroom. Khadija and Dominique welcomed us and recommended us what to see during our (very short) time in Tanger and on our way to the airport. The only thing that I think could be improved is the breakfast.",5
"Love, love, love this hotel! This hotel has everything we wanted and more. The location is perfect, The Breakfast and Tea are great and ALL the staff are amazing!  We were anxious since we had a flight delay and then our ferry was cancelled, however we got on the late ferry, let the hotel know and the taxi driver was there waiting for us. We were warmly greeted at the hotel with tea and delicious treats, and taken to our room. The room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. We went down for a delicious breakfast and then walked around the Kasbah and the Market, what a beautiful city! We came back and drank tea on the rooftop and enjoyed the beautiful view. Khadija and Dominique were so helpful and gracious to us the entire time we were there, I believe making the choice…",5
"We only stayed one night, but the warmth and hospitality of the proprietor and his assistant really made us feel very welcome and at home. A very relaxed atmosphere, no pressure whatsoever, beautifully and tastefully decorated with fascinating artifacts from all over Morocco. I found the use of tadelakt plastering pretty interesting, and the array of carpets installed a preview to shopping for them in the medina later. Bathroom and shower were well appointed and clean. Breakfast was generous, with a second portion of omelettes made for us to enjoy, we also enjoyed the beghrir (pancakes) and coffee. We also had time to enjoy the view over the medina and the Straights of Gibraltar from the rooftop terrace, although the weather was a little on the cool side. Overall a great place,…",5
"I have no idea how this establishment gets five stars. We have traveled all over the world and this was, to our eyes, a back packers hotel. If that.  We arrived at Tanjgers the airport at 11:30 PM. The hotel knew this, we had communicated with them several times,  and they had sent a car. Fine. I had informed them that we were coming from Marrakech via Casablanca and I would think they would  know what our travel day had probably been like. There is no food service on the RAM short flights, atleast that we were on,  and there was only a coffee shop, that ran out of everything in the Casablanca airport domestic flight area. It was a sorry scene with a lot of tired people sleeping on the floors.  We were picked up on time and driven to a spot where the cab could go no further. …",1
"What a wonderful hotel. Spotlessly clean, lovely facilities and a stunning terrace for breakfast, views of Tangier and to catch the sun. But most of all the staff were very helpful. From making sure we arrived safely, to pointing out local landmarks and arranging an excellent tour guide. I would recommend this place to any other visitor.",5
"From the warm welcome to help getting to the train station when we left for Casa Blanca  was a five star experience . The service was impeccable. The owner,manager and staff were so eager to please.The breakfast was perfect and served each morning with great care and grace on the lovely rooftop deck. The owner and staff catered to our every need from hailing taxis, making sure we were not overcharged, bringing drinks to the roof top terrace or helping us navigate Tangiers,The location is somewhat hard to find but once you do you are in a great spot close to the Medina, the Kasbah and the beaches You will find tranquility once you  enter through the doors of this  well renovated luxurious boutique hotel. This has every modern amenity while still steeped in tradition. We would…",5
"A very warm and helpful welcome with mint tea. We were very short on time, one afternoon, within half an hour the lady that welcomed us had organised a whistle stop tour with a great local taxi driver they recommend, we would not have seen as much as we did if it was not for her. Her passion for Morocco and Tangiers was infectious. The Riad was beautiful, our room Bedouia was very quiet, with a beautiful comfy four poster bed, very spacious and just lovely. We wished we had been able to stay for longer than just our one night. The roof terrace had a great view, with some lovely comfy chairs to relax in with a drink after our whistlestop tour.",5
"If you were going to create a perfect concierge, you could not do better than the young lady who is the day manager.   She is personable, knowledgeable, and helpful.   She made sure we got everything we needed from something to drink to phone chargers to breakfast at an ungodly hour because we had to leave for a day trip at 5AM. The rest of the small staff is also very pleasant and helpful.   The facility is comfortable and attractive with lovely art works throughout.   They have a hammam on site, but we had no time to try it.  Maybe next time.  ",5
"This hotel was clean and tasteful in furnishings. Even more impressive was the personal interest the hostess extended to make sure her guests were comfortable. At our request, our hostess made sure someone was there at the airport to pick us up in a country unfamiliar to us. Through the hotel, we had the opportunity for a tour which took us to specific sites we would probably not find otherwise. We recommend this hotel to all peaceable travelers, including families.",5
"Is not space enough to talk about this beautiful Boutique Hotel in the heart of the Medina? We booked here last minute hoping for a good service and value for money. I must say the place is over the top. From the first moment, Khadija who is the Manager offered us a full overview of the place and we had a fantastic chat with a local tea. She showed us the rooms and the facilities and explained us everything that we needed to know. The rooms are just amazingly decorated. Each of them with a personal touch and colours keeping the tradition but also the comfort. The rooms have incidental music that can be controlled as desired and is great for a good sleep and relaxation. The views from the rooftop are just amazing and are also the breakfast place. I wish we could have more time to…",5
"Our group of 7 started our 2 week journey through Morocco in Tangier, staying at Dar Chams Tanja.  Getting to the inn was interesting; seemed like a back alley entrance.  However, we soon learned that most of Morocco seems like a back alley entrance, and some of the most amazing inns are tucked into the most unlikely locations.  The warm welcome here was exceptional!  We were given our rooms without delay and the staff was wonderful.  Rooms were as gorgeous as the pictures indicate.  We woke up to a fabulous breakfast with an incredible variety of foods set before us.  Flying into Tangier (vs. Casablanca) turned out to be a great decision, and staying at this lovely inn was as well.",5
"We had a wonderful 3 days at this beautiful riad.  Everything was well presented and well maintained.  We had a spacious room and comfortable king-size bed on the second floor with a large bathroom and excellent amenities.  There was some noise from the outside but it did not disturb us unduly, and the aircon was rather weak at times but not too bad.  The roof terrace was enchanting and delightful, as were the breakfasts served there.  The roof top view in Tangier is prettier, we thought, than in Marrakech, Fez or Essaouira (but not, of course, Chefchaoune which was truly spectacular); there is more colour and variety here than elsewhere.  Be prepared to walk up and down hills to and from the riad - but this is a feature of Tangier as a whole, and nothing is very far away.  The…",5
This Riad was just perfect in every way. The hostess was just as wonderful as she could be. So welcoming and friendly. The furnishings were beautiful and our room was so comfortable we really didn't want to leave!! I would highly recommend this Riad and also that you stay a couple or three days at least in Tangier as it was one of my favorite spots in Morocco. The breakfasts here were beautiful and the rooftop desk simply stunning views of the city!!,5
"Beautiful property, terrific breakfasts on rooftop lounge and incredibly warm, welcoming, and helpful hostess, Khadija! Khadija served us tea and cookies when we arrived, and chatted with us about what we hoped to do and see during our time in Tangier. She lined up trusted guides and drivers to help us meet our goals.  The day that we left she had a private breakfast prepared for us, since we had to depart before the usual breakfast time! All in all, beautiful property gracious hostess...I’ll return!",5
"We stayed in Dar Chams for 2 nights.  This would be my husbands and I third visit to Tangier.  Last time we stayed in La Tangerina and were really quite spoiled. We weren't let down so to speak in Dar Chams, but a few things if we were to compare would be value fo money, outside nose (out of their control) cost of eating in the Riad, and no control over the air conditioning,   1) We found the Riad at €140 a night expensive on the points made above. 2) We ate in the Riad the first night on arrival and felt that the food although delicious, was very expensive at €76 in total which included a shared tangine, salad, and 2 glasses of wine each and a small dessert. We at out during the day for lunch and were spoiled with options of gorgeous food. 3) Air conditioning- at the cost of…",4
"I only stayed here one night, so I did not really get the full out of it, but I would love to prolong it and sure would not miss a thing. The house is just beautiful, with care in every detail and a terrasse with a 360 degree view over Tangier and the ocean. I arrived early, and was prepared to just leave my luggage and come back later, but had a warm welcome by Khadija, who served selfmade pastries and tea and showed me the house and my room. The room is well equipped with great comfort.",5
"The most wonderful welcome by Mr Dominique and Khadija. This would be the warmest and most informative welcome we have recieved at any hotel, world wide. Not to mention the wonderful Mint tea, served in great style.  All hotel staff we're lovely and very helpful. The breakfast was a wonderful selection of local food, followed by an omelette cooked well.  A knowledge of more French would have helped us a little.  A little more expensive than some other hotels, but get over it.....  you will appreciate your decision, if you like a great boutique hotel filled with great people.  Khadija prearranged the services of a very good English speaking guide to pick us up from the ferry, then look after us for the period of our stay.  Mohammad Ali was our guide and made our trip loads of fun…",5
"Definitely higher priced for Morocco however you get what you pay for:  this is secure, safe, beautiful, and breakfasts are delicious.  Our innkeeper ""Kitch"" was so very helpful and kind.  Highly recommend!!!!!!",5
"We had a lovely 2-night stay in this gorgeous hotel.  The hotel is beautifully decorated in the Moroccan style and run by a wonderful French gentleman named Dominic and his wife.  Upon our arrival we were offered mint tea and delicious coconut cookies.  Dominic welcomed us and gave us an overview of Tangier, lending us a guidebook for the city.  He was very helpful throughout our stay, and recommended several very good Moroccan restaurants for dinner (Dar Lidam and Salon Bleu Cafe).  We stayed in the Soussia suite, which was clean and spacious with a sitting area, a bathroom with a large shower, and decorated with beautiful paintings by a local artist.  The bed was very comfortable.  The complimentary breakfast was very nice and served on the rooftop terrace.  The hotel's only…",4
"The B&B is in the old historical town , room clean and breakfast extravagant.  The host made sure there was a cab to meet us at the ferry and also arranged a tour guide.  We learned many historical facts on the tour with Yosef.  Dominic was gracious and apologized for his English, his wife was in France.  We found him charming and helpful with restaurants, all were fabulous. Yes, if you are a light sleeper, just know you are in a local's area but then that is why you immerse here.  My only comments is to maybe have an English menu as at times it was hard to communicate with the staff,they do not speak English. By menu I mean just in case you only want coffee and toast or just juice.  The English words would help them. We would be honored to come back and stay here in the future,…",5
The rooms were nice and clean. The staff was awesome. Very accommodating. Keep in mind this hotel is in the Medina and it can get pretty loud at night so bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Great experience. Would stay again.,4
"We absolutely loved our stay at this bed-and-breakfast! The location could not be more perfect...I cannot emphasize this enough! The BNB is IN the Casbah, you literrally are staying right in the neighborhood. The owners, Michele and Dominique were extremely helpful and gave wonderful tips on where to eat and places to visit. The restaurant that is on the exact opposite side of the building where the bed-and-breakfast is located is fantastic. You must try it. I came to this bed and breakfast with my 14-year-old son for his birthday. There was not one moment, not even a second, where I felt unsafe in Tangier or in Morocco. We had a blast! The Tangerines were so friendly! Don't do the day trip to Tangier. You will really miss out on so much.  Definitely stay over and immerse…",5
"We recently stayed 2 nights with Dominic and Michelle, taking over all the property's 7 rooms. Apart from the lovely rooms and roof terrace with superb views, it is the personal touch that makes all the difference here. They are constantly on hand to look after you and offer useful advice and information. The delicious breakfast is prepared and served by their constantly smiling staff under Michelle's supervision. The property is just below the Kasbah thus strategically placed for exploring the Medina and Souks.",5
"I do not understand how anyone could recommend this hotel! My wife and I have stayed in hotels all over Morocco and this  one was, by far, the worst experience. It is difficult to find in the medina of Tangiers and requires carrying luggage nearly 75 yards down steep, deteriorated steps once the hotel is found. The owners and staff barely speak any English and therefore were not helpful with normal questions about the attractions, directions, etc. The view from the room was non-existent. Noisy would be an understatement! And if you had any ideas of checking what was going on in the world, forget it: a few TV stations all French or Spanish only. We finally left two days early after seeing a roach in the room.",2
"This place could not feel more authentic even though it is newly built. The furnishings are luxurious, the breakfast is excellent, and the hosts are helpful.  Rooms in the interior are very quiet. Would highly recommend staying here.",5
"Michelle and her staff were great in helping book restaurants and tours around Tanger. Do yourself a favour and stay at Dar Chams Tanja! You will be in the lap of luxury inside the Casbah! Great breakfast outside on the terrace, overlooking the city of Tanger. On our last day before the ferry to Tarifa, Michelle organized a 3 hour taxi tour of the city including all the sites, camel ride and snake charmer, and a drop off at the ferry terminal. ",5
"This riad is absolutely the best in our trip. Because I want to see different roof in medina of Tanger, so before I arrived I booked two riad in Tanger, one riad for two nights. My boyfriend complains to me everyday when we changed to another riad. Because Dar Chams has perfect staff, the night manager helped us a lot and the cleaner is so professional, which let us not want to go outside. The massage is also amazing. If we go to Tanger again, we will booked it again!! ",5
The hotel is located near the kasbah of the medina of Tangier. Dar Chams architect lives with harmony with the neighbor building while the interior design contains preserved the characters of the traditional Morocco decor. You can enjoy the panoramic view of the city at the roof top of the building.  The interior decor is cozy.  Breakfast is nice and owner and all the staff are friendly and helpful.  We would strongly recommend this hotel. I would definitely choose to stay in Dar Chams without hesitation if i am going to visit Tangier again.,5
