"New modern hotel. Clean apartments, spacious and comfortable. The staff was exceptional from the moment we arrived, to the breakfast to check out they were always friendly, helpful and doing their best to please you.

"This Hotel is the best. New and nice rooms, well equiped (Kirchen, microwave, Washing machine, Drying rack (but on Request)   Good Location near Marina & Malabata .  Great Breakfast and very friendly staff. I will come back for sure.",5
"Great stay. Well-equipped aprtments. Great staff and very good breakfast!  The best part was when we went for lunch, the Tajine de Boeuf is the best in Tanger!!! you should try it! The location was also very convenient near the marina and a lot of cool places to explore",5
"Great Stay! Since the moment we arrived, for the first time in marroco, the bellboy was very helpful, the front desk as easy and welcoming. Restaurant is good with traditional food (AMAZING Tajine!!) and more international one like salads, tapas. The Breakfast buffet, it was fantastic! for 90MAD you have very good pastry, natural juices, and you can even ask for an omelette made at the moment in show cooking. The waiters are kind, and they always try to help you. The apartment were also very well-equipped and very clean. There is a washing machine and you cal also ask for an iron and board, and also a clothesline to dry your clothes. Great if you've been travelling for a few weeks! The location is very good, near the marina and a good walk until the medina. Also, a supermarket is within 5 minutes distance. Thank you Pestana Tanger team to make my stay a memorable one.…",5
