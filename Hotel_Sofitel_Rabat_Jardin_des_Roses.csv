review,rating
"After last visiting the Riu Palace Agadir in 2017 and having lovely memories of the hotel, we decided to try it again. This time for 12 nights. What I remember most was how amazing the staff were. That was the biggest take away from our trip in 2017. This time we were coming with our 3 year old daughter and 3 month old baby so it was a very different holiday from our last!  Right off the bat - nothing has changed (which is such a nice thing!). All the public spaces were still sparking like new. The floors and walls gleamed, which was no surprise as everyone took so much pride in their work and the property.   There are a few reviews where people say they feel ignored at the bar. I don't really understand this as the hotel was really busy, if not full and I don't think I had to wait long for someone to offer a drink. You dont even need to go to the bar as if the waiters see you without a drink you will be offered one along with olives and nuts in minutes! The bar staff were amazing. Hats off to them! All the drinks were branded in the lobby bar and there was such a good selection.  The pool bars were just as great too with staff always smiling and helpful. They were so wonderful with my kids and would always make her a special cocktail!   Restaurants - again, flawless service. The staff from the waiters and waitresses to the people manning the live stations were awesome. You would go to take a lamb chop that had been sitting on the tray and before you could take it, it a freshly cooked chop would be put on your plate instead! It was really busy and yet the staff never seemed too busy to help or to have a chat with you to make you feel welcome. It was also the way they remembered what you liked, even though the hotel was busy the service felt so personal.   The Animation team - wow. Those guys spend the entire day on the feet and still somehow manage to put on a show every evening. My Daughter was in love with all of them and they made her feel so special where-ever they saw her! Even when we were saying goodbye they gave her a certificate for her dancing!   I think this is the standout thing about this hotel - they are able to adapt and deliver such an impressive service to both couples and families alike! My kids were so wonderfully welcome and when we came as a couple 5 years ago for a romantic holiday - thats the holiday we had. Its quite a rare thing for a hotel to be everything to everyone.   My wife loved the Spa and the Manager simply adored my daughter and even offered her free treatments which was so touching!    Room cleaning was flawless - would pop out, come back and like Ninja's they would have the room sparkling again!!   Usually, I would list some people who really stood out but if I did this my review would go on forever!! Everyone stood out in some way. From Security, Reception, Bars, Animation, Cleaning, Porters, Waiters, Waitresses, Chiefs, Cooks, Spa - we had such wonderful iterations with everyone. Even our Taxi driver kept saying 'its the best hotel in Agadir as we pulled up - and he was not wrong!'  The Management should feel exceptionally proud of this property. A hotel is only ever as good as its people - and the people here are truly the best!  My Daughter said it was the best holiday she has ever had and I'm so grateful to everyone at the Riu Palace for giving her such a beautiful memory!   We will be back but next time we certainly wont leave it 5 years!!!…",5
"Our trip to Agadir came about through a number of trips being cancelled due to COVID.  We have been to Rui hotels before and we weren’t disappointed by our visit to Tikida Palace.  When we arrived at around one in the morning, the hotel had left a restaurant open for us to get some food.  There were three of us in the entire restaurant and this was an amazing touch by the hotel team.  Yes there were some restrictions during our stay, but these were communicated well by the hotel team.  There was a good selection of food on the buffet every lunch and evening.  Moroccan dishes were always available as well as a huge range of meats, salads and amazing desserts.  The bar was well stocked with brand names and the pool bar provided a large range of cocktails expertly Mixed throughout the day.  The greatest asset of this hotel was the people who worked there.  Nothing was ever too much trouble and little things like remembering your drinks, table service and just generally having a chat with the guests made our stay very enjoyable.  The rooms were spacious and a mini bar of soft drinks was replenished each day.  The pool was good and the beach was literally a stones throw away.  I will be visiting other Rui hotels in the future as this has confirmed that you will always have an enjoyable holiday of you stay at their hotels …",5
"I first visited when the hotel first open so on my return visit my expectations were the same. My holiday was still good , food was excellent but the service was changeable.rooms were nice and cleaned well but often had to ask for milk and tea supplies. Hotel itself in need of repairs in some areas.",3
"The hotel itself is beautiful, the food is great, plentiful, tasty and a good standard, didn’t try the a la carte so can’t comment on them. The waitress we had at breakfast, lunch and dinner were all great (we were lucky to always have the same ones), my husband has a tomato allergy and they were always willing to help if needed. I do have to say there doesn’t seem to be any dress code in the restaurant. A big group of French came in their football kit one evening singing at the top of their voices, fortunately   The bar staff I have to say were awful, unless you were a regular or French. On occasion at the bar I had to ask 4 times to get the correct drink as the person serving me was to busy talking to people he already knew. On another occasion on of the bar staff walked passed us on pool side having just served someone else, I asked for a drink, he said yes and then walked off.  The bar outside upstairs was great, they remembered our drinks after dinner everyday, as they knew what we had. (Btw we were tippers so this wasn’t the reason for it).   The maids were fantastic, very friendly and the rooms were always spotless.   Overall a great hotel, for us personally it was the bar staff that let them down.   Be careful of local taxis always check how much it should be before getting in a taxi, we knew some people got heavily over charged ( reception will tell you how much)…",4
Great device for coach drop off to leaving hotel . Staff very helpful and entertainment team good round the pool .Food was never the same and good quality every day. The rooms were good quality and pool was great  Will visit again ,5
"Right on the beach, well located for shopping and if you want to visit coffee shops and restaurants outside hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff. Lovely pool area and spa. The lobby bars are very nice and one of them has entertainment",5
Visited for a week with my mum.  Had to move rooms on arrival (preference didn’t like ground floor) however the ground floor room was stifling hot and the air-con broken.  Second room was much better 3rd floor  Breakfast is very poor service - everyday sat a table that wasn’t cleaned properly had to ask for clean cutlery on multiple occasions.  Lunch in the snack bar was left overs from the previous day or hamburgers (daily) and evening meal was repetitive although somewhat better than breakfast. The best meal was one we had out that we paid for!  The 2 restaurants were nice however you do need to book in advance and there was no sign of the Italian open at all.  Pool bar drinks are not good.  Lobby bar drinks are good when you can get served. Waiters going to tables and others completely ignored.  Entertainment was non existent.  Spa treatments are nice  Room was always cleaned properly  Hotel is becoming dated with rips in the wall paper and broken furniture.  Far away from a 5* resort…,2
Good quality hotel from entry to the beach . Rooms spotless and spacious. Staff very helpful and all happy to help you. The food is spot on and you never get bored of it  The animation team work hard and really good with the quests The hotel location is perfect for all activities and the TUI rep is very helpful. Best hotel I have been in and great weather for November  Will return again  Only short flight from Manchester  Thanks to the RIU staff,5
"Wow!!!! The entertainment group ,ayoub,Aziz,moncf ,jannat,Hamza,amazing group together working as a team to entertain the guests.. We had an awesome time at Riu hotel.. Thank you guys. Reception staff was excellent too.. cleaning staff was friendly.",5
"This is by far one of the best resorts I have stayed in. Did not want to leave, along with all of the other people we met while we were there.  The animation/entertainment team are so fun and energetic, they really made it one to remember. They are so welcoming and make you feel comfortable and give you the confidence to get up and dance and have some fun throughout the day. Then at night they are the evening entertainment where they can really show of their talent. In particular, Aziz's breakdancing was mesmerising, never seen anything like it. He was also very welcoming and fun to be around. Hamza and Ismail are also great and kept us entertained when we didn't want to stop dancing. Along with the rest of the talented team who always had a smile on their faces and would come over for a chat and a laugh with us. My favourite show was the African themed night. The rest of the staff were amazing too, they all work so hard, all around the pool, in the restaurants, cleaning, reception. Everyone is so friendly and polite. The hotel itself is very beautiful and is situated on the walkway of the beach, which also has its own private area for the resort guests. We went on one of the Tui Atlas Mountain tours, which was so fun and interesting. We had breakfast and lunch in a house of one of the locals, visited Paradise Valley for a swim and visited the Sand Dunes along the coast. It was one of my favourite days and was so beautiful. It is such an amazing place to stay. I would go back tomorrow if I could!…",5
"Well 6th time at this hotel and.nothing has changed. Fantastic staff, great food, great facilities and more great friends and memories. Can't think of anything negative to dayvatcall....again   Can't really fault this hotel at all. Yes we will book again for next year. ",5
"Not sure how anyone can fault this place .. superb range of food, top service wherever you are in the hotel, clean BIG room .. the grounds are immaculately kept. You can quickly access the beach through the back gate and walk along the promenade. There are a few sellers about there, but they’re pretty friendly after a firm ‘no’.",5
"I stayed at the hotel from the 7th of November to the 14th,  I would just like to say I was a little concerned reading some of the reviews before I went, however I found out for myself that this hotel is absolutely beautiful, I found all staff were very accommodating and friendly from reception to the Restaurants, the bar staff, and the pool guys,  I never found it a problem to find a sunbed even though I wouldn’t reach the pool until 10 o’clock.  I also had no problems in the restaurant with cold food as suggested, I always found something to eat it was plentiful with lots of different dishes to choose from.  The room are large and the reception is stunning in the pool area is also very relaxing and also stylish.  All the staff working extremely hard and with a smile and…",4
"We arrived here on 29th October and as soon as we arrived late at night were greeted by big smiles and friendliest of staff.  The reception area is beautiful with a beautiful piano bar. We were told that we should go eat so we didn’t miss out as our flight had been delayed which was great.  When we arrived at  our room after the most simple speedy check in we were so pleasantly surprised it was clean and spacious with dressing area lounge area and bathroom, as well as a lovely sitting area over looking pool.  The food here is amazing and the deserts don’t only look amazing they taste unbelievably good.  The staff from every area of the hotel were the warmest friendliest people who couldn’t do enough for you. You could tell that seeing you happy made them happy and they looked…",5
"First class service from when we arrived to when we left , 2weels of luxury,  great staff great food lovely rooms nice and spacious,  spotlessly clean and tidy 5 star great pool and terrace,  direct access to the promenade great view of the hill side many thanx jonxkaren ",5
"First holidayed here 3 years ago and were due to come again when the pandemic kicked in, so was lovely to be able to return at last. Everything was as we remembered it, beautiful hotel. Maybe apart from the odd one, the staff are lovely and work so hard to deliver an amazing, friendly service, they are so hardworking.  Would always recommend you pay that little extra and book a pool view room though. And unless you are on the ground floor a lot of them also give a sea view.  Our own experiences here have been extremely positive and wouldn't hesitate to return or recommend to anyone.",5
Excellent hotel helpful staff lovely rooms. Food was first class and having three themed restaurants made the all inclusive less boring. Definitely recommended. Perfect weather in October making it an ideal winter destination ,5
"Had a terrible experience with this hotel resort. Would not recommend to anyone. Had booked the hotel for a 5 night stay. However, our first day and night were a terrible experience. The toilet plumbing smelt bad and made noises all night. Our room was on the ground floor so it was noisy all night due to guests. The hotel was very busy throughout the day and night - guests all over all the sun beds, in the gym and pools, and in all the relaxation spaces. Food was poor quality and abysmal range, not appetising at all. Smelt of alcohol everywhere. Rooms look dated and need renovating. Overall extremely poor for the price charged.  After one night stay, we therefore decided to check out the next morning due to all the reasons above and cancel the rest of our booking. The hotel…",1
"My  gf and I stayed a few months ago and we loved it, facilities are well maintaind and clean, food was good, staff was warm and helpful, We met the resort manager Sergio and took care of us so well and made our stay great, definitely we will come back.",5
"Arrived on a late night flight to be greeted with complimentary drinks. Sadly, the check in took over an hour so our first impression was not great. Then the lift wouldn’t work so we had to carry the cases up the stairs ( luckily only one flight) Once we got in the room everything became much more positive. It was a lovely room with twin beds pushed next to each other, lounge area and big bathroom.  The bed was rather hard and the duvet cover was extremely heavy but we slept ok.  The hotel is beautiful throughout with a good selection of food and drinks on hand 24 hours a day.  The pool area was kept beautifully clean and there were plenty of sun beds so no need to be up early to get one. There was also part of the beach sectioned off for guests.  There are sellers on the…",4
"Having visited this hotel for many years it still lives up to my expectations,my only complaint is that they have introduced karaoke which I don’t think is compatible with a 5* hotel also the singer by the piano was absent more than he was there and too many animation team shows more outside entertainment is wanted",5
"This was our first visit to Morocco and what an exceptional stay we had. This hotel boasts a Moroccan vibe with fine interior decor and surroundings which were being maintained throughout our stay. Fine attention to detail to Moroccan cuisine which provided a range of dining options , albeit quite busy at times. As an example, chefs prepared Halloween Themed dining, which helped maintain traditions away from home. The waiting staff are very attentive and friendly and work hard to ensure needs are met at dining times, wine glasses were never empty.  The food was cooked to high standards and cleanliness maintained always at dining areas.   The hotel provides excellent drinks with a  24 hour hotel bar and pool side bars open during pool opening times.    We arranged a la carte…",4
"Terrible experience. Old duvets, smelly, noisy toilets, cheap and low quality buffet food. I would definitely not use this hotel again. Entrance area is impressive, everything else is below par and poor quality.",1
"Holiday 29.09.22 for two weeks, weather was very good although some days overcast. We've been holidaying at this hotel regularly since it opened.  The hotel overall is lovely and spacious, the main reception area is impressive and comfortable. Rooms are very spacious, comfortable and clean with a good mini bar service.  Although some sun beds were reserved, we never had a problem finding any and the pool staff were helpful.  The food is excellent, with a good choice available, it was nice to meet some of the chefs at meal times who were very friendly and happy to chat.  Activities are available throughout the day, no pressure if you just want to lay in the sun.  But the jewel in the crown are the staff at this hotel, they are brilliant, nothing is too much trouble, always…",5
"Fantastic 5* hotel but the rooms are (not more) at the level of a palace. The rest was perfect. Swimming pools, bars, restaurants. Just in front of the sea with easy access. A lot of facilities in the hotel and an amazing spa. Service at the reception could be improved.",4
Staff were excellent especially Sharky and Abdel. We had a wonderful time for my birthday and the staff just made it incredible. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking to go to Morocco!,5
"We arrived at 2am and the reception was good. We went to the restaurant for a 'snack' and a drink then went to our room. With it being so late, we didn't have an opportunity to have a good look round. The next morning we went straight to breakfast and to the pool. Sunbeds were plentiful and not an issue. People occupying them  however, were smoking, drinking  being, noisy  and moaning if they got splashed by a ball....don't sit on the ones by the front of the pool then! The whole hotel (all indoor areas) are so dark, its a struggle to see most of the time. The power went out twice while we werw there and it was out for over an hour each time. The food was mediocre to say the least. There is no variety and it just doesn't taste nice. My husband was ill for the last 3 days of our…",2
"What a great service and time we had, Abdel Simo Ismail and all the other entertainment team were great and so helpful. They were all amazing with our three-year-old and six-year-old sons and couldn’t do enough for us. Thanks guys and will be back.",5
Well what can I say. It took 4 days to get milk delivered to the room for coffee. It took 4 days to get bathrobes. Net curtains in the room had blood stains and were very shabby. Bathroom very tired especially the bath. Black mould all the way mastic join. Overall very disappointed with the condition of the room. Have visited many times but fear this will be the last until a refurb is done. Entertainment very disappointing and amateurish. Food and serving staff absolutely first class. Come on Riu- fix the hotel.,3
"This hotel is very big its got lots of sun beds its immaculately clean BUT the food is often luke warm especially the pasta, my husband got food poisoning on day 2, the female staff can be aloof and not very helpful may be a culture thing ? The balcony door fell apart on day one, see attached photos maintenance came within an hour and fixed it but we were a bit worried about it breaking again. The outside bars are constantly running out of glasses and the head barman is often shouting at his staff who then run around collecting them why not just buy more.",2
"We visited the hotel in October 22.    The hotel and the staff are amazing, it is so clean and the staff can't do enough for you, we found every member of staff friendly and they wanted to serve to make sure your holiday was a great one.  The rooms were clean and very large, at other hotels the standard room would be classed as a suite.  We also got a free upgrade to a executive suite over looking the sea, I can honestly say that it's the biggest hotel room I have ever seen, it was massive.  The food was very good, but the reason I have given four stars and not 5 is the food was very repetitive.  We understood there were 3 al-a-cartes, but while we were there the Italian was closed, (after asking some of the staff we were told it was due to them having problems with staff…",4
"Sadly disappointed with the whole Agadir experience. Our first impression of the hotel on walking through the door was ‘wow!’ The entrance, bar and lounge area is truly impressive with beautiful decor… it promised so much. From that point onwards however it was more than a little disappointing. The sheer size of the hotel is clearly not for us… if quantity over quality is your thing then this could be your ideal holiday. Canteen food served in a canteen environment… We tried the specialty restaurants… the Moroccan cuisine was terrible… the Asian slightly better but still not good. The drinks were standard for an all inclusive… limited choice and weak. The bedrooms were very good, large, well appointed and kept very clean throughout our stay. Sun beds were plentiful, although the…",3
"Congratulations to the managers for creating this amazing experience and respect to the staff for working so hard to make it happen.  Beautiful resort, great service, tasty food. Highly recommended. The pool is the highlight of the resort, and the lobby bar a very pleasant surprise, extremely lively",4
"Right where do I start.... I'll be honest and fair in this review because like any trip there are some good points and some that could make it better but at the end of the day, would I return?? That would be a wholehearted yes I would! We stayed for 10 days all inc and asked for a quiet room. We arrived late and there was some cold food/snacks available if we wanted after we'd checked in, although we didn't bother it was good to know we could've if we wanted. Check in was warmly welcoming, smooth and swift which was appreciated. The room, 4069, was spacious, tidy and clean. Yes, it overlooked an across the way car park but this wasn't an issue and was as requested, quiet. It was fairly close to the open bar terrace at night but that closed at 11pm so no issue. I will say this...…",4
"The hotel is absolutely beautiful, from the lobby garden area and pool. The hotel rooms are good size. Only down side to room I was on the Aircon wasn't very good and shower was inside the bath and no light. Got courtesy room on last day with walk in shower so much better.   The staff as amazing couldn't help you enough. From getting to seated in the restaurant to topping up drinks. Rashid at the pool bar was amazing so was Abdul wahid, also Hasan in the 24hr bar.  The food was really good plenty to choose from, also the Moroccan and Krystal restaurants. Gutted the Italian was closed as only open in the summer.   1 thing I think could make the place better is the outside seat area near the pool could be used on a night doing a BBQ or some type of event adding more seating and…",5
"We had a week here in October 2022. It was the first time we had gone to an all inclusive resort and we were very pleasantly surprised.  It is a well appointed hotel, the rooms are large and comfortable and the pool area, the bars, restaurants and common areas clean and well maintained.  The food was fantastic, especially considering the sheer amount of people catered for. A wide choice for all diets with a lot of variety including a daily tagine to get the local flavour.  The staff were very good, some of them really outstanding and friendly. Particular mention to Abdessalam of the animations team, who played petanque with us was a great presence around the pool area and even ran a class to learn some Arabic/Berber language phrases.  We will definitely return here after such a…",5
"Like many, we were worried when a slew of 1-star reviews flooded TripAdvisor for this hotel a few weeks before we travelled. Fortunately, I'm happy to report the hotel was very good, though not the 5-star experience it claims.  The rooms are large but dark thanks to the dark wood prevalent throughout the hotel, and general lack of lighting. Here the hotel loses a star for the dark bathroom, drawers that didn't close properly, rubbish aircon, and a minor ant problem.   The public spaces, however, are grand, spacious and clean, with plenty of seating. The pool area is a major draw, with its mix of sturdy sunbeds and cabanas. Yes, no one adheres to the no reservation policy, but the average care-free traveller won't have much trouble finding a bed, even later in the day. There's…",4
"My husband and i arrived at this hotel on 22nd September for 2 weeks . We arrived around 11pm , checked in and went straight to the restaurant which was kept open for late arrivals . There was a good selection of food on offer .  We requested a room change the following morning (just for a nicer view ) and we were given  a great room on the ground floor right by the pool (Room 1020). The staff throughout the hotel were brilliant , . The manager must be so proud of his staff . The manager himself always made a point of welcoming the guests around the hotel , especially in the restaurants .The food was very good in all the restaurants , plenty of choice for different tastes .  There was always plenty of sunbeds around the beautiful pool and on the private part of the beach . …",5
"We have just got back from a lovely week at the Riu Palace in Agadir. The hotel is beautiful; all of the furnishings are top class, the pool area is luxurious and it is exceptionally clean. Honestly, I’ve never seen a hotel so throughly cleaned every single day, in both the rooms and throughout all of the public areas too. The staff are mostly very friendly and go out of their way to welcome you. Three people deserve a shoutout and huge applause from management from our stay - HAFID in the restaurant, RACHID barman by the pool and IBRAHIM who helps by the pool every day - wow, these three gentlemen really looked after us. We hope the hotel recognise this review and thank them for their incredible service.   We would highly recommend the buggy experience which we booked via our…",4
Just come back from our 1st visit to Morocco   This hotel is lovely hotel grounds are well kept & clean staff are all very polite friendly & helpful  Rooms are a little dated with dark furniture could do with some updating the bathrooms with the baths in I think that the bath should be removed shower wasn’t brilliant no light in the shower over the bath so was a bit dark when having a shower.   Food was nice but was limited with the Italian restaurant closed for dinner & only one place to eat at lunch with the snack bar I think there could more themed dinners in the buffet restaurant both Krystal & Moroccan restaurant nice but again limited on food choice.  Pool is really beautiful & kept clean everyday   All in all we did have a lovely stay,4
"Beautiful hotel! Weather was fabulous while we where there, staff at this hotel are great, do the best with what they have. Food is typically what you would expect from all inclusive, breakfast was always my favourite meal of the day, evening meal I sometimes struggled with. Cocktails are hit and miss depending on who makes them. They do serve champagne /sparkling wine and plenty of it! Although not always around the pool area but a tip here and there goes a long way! Pool area is what makes this hotel stand out…we had both a pool view and sea view. Would I return? For a relaxing break at the right price yes….if its action you are after, the area in general isn’t very lively.",4
"So this is my honest review after 11 nights at this hotel following reading so many worrying reviews. We visited for our honeymoon and we’re not expecting 5 star London. We had been to Marrakech so knew Moroccan standards and this hotel blew us away with being so lovely!  Reception was busy with a positive atmosphere when we arrived even after midnight, a number of members of the team on reception making check in pleasant and swift. We were blown away we were greeted with the restaurant being open AND serving hot food such as fries, steak, stuffed peppers along with breads, cold cut meats, cheese, desserts etc, we went to bed after travelling with full tummies- great start!  The room was incredibly spacious! His and hers sinks, clean, fresh & welcoming with a vase of fresh…",4
"Lovely hotel, lovely room and food. Staff were really attentive. Plenty of sun beds no need to rush out early morning and save one. The pool staff are always ready to get your bed set up and find you a parasol. Would definitely go again ",5
"Just coming back from this hotel, was unsure what to expect having never been to Morocco and reading some less than positive reviews recently...firstly the staff are excellent, you do have to tip to get the premium service levels, so I would advise getting some change and tipping, 20dir here and there is nothing for the service you get! The massive plus side to this hotel is the pool area! It is probably one of the best I've stayed in anywhere! The food is very good, good selection and plenty of different dishes for all (maybe not the greatest for children but I would recommend this place for children, there is very little for them to do here!) Rooms are a good size and stocked with drinks every day, cleaned well and are generally good! The hotel is stunning inside, one of the…",5
"Currently sat in the beautiful reception/bar area, as we've checked out but our transfer isn't until 9.30pm.  Everything about this place is generally as beautiful as all the pictures you will ever see, reception area huge and luxurious.   Rooms, starting to feel a little tired, but certainly didn't put us off in any way.  Food, mmm I've not been impressed to be honest.  Breakfast in the main restaurant wasn't the best, as said before lukewarm sausages, fried eggs with lots of runny whites, and some of the usual things you recognise don't taste as you'd expect them too. Lunch in the snackbar/Italian restaurant was extremely repetitive so as long as you enjoy burgers, pizza etc your ok. Evening meal in the main restaurant again, didn't seem to have a great deal of choice and…",4
"I felt ignored at times by the staff, but the personal trainer at the gym, Mo, was incredibly friendly with me and had so much knowledge about the human anatomy. Nice hotel, mixture of attitudes amongst staff, not quite what I was told to expect. But I'm a blank man, so maybe that's why I was overlooked",3
"Tikida Palace is the best hotel we have ever stayed at. Its stunning exterior and interior makes it appealing for all, whilst it is a big hotel, it never feels too big or too much. The pool and poolside is always kept so clean and comfortable. Facilities are also great - the indoor pool is lovely, gym is good too. The bar areas inside and outside are lovely, they create a great atmosphere and such comfortable surroundings. With the hotel being on the beach, the view all day from the hotel (especially sitting outside at the restaurant) was absolutely incredible & so special. The hotel has great access to everything you need! The fridge in the room also gets topped up every few days and they are more than happy to give you anything you need.  I can honestly say that one of the…",5
Came here for a mini baby moon! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The hotel is probably the best on the strip luxurious wise.   The only negative I would say is the hotel is so large getting around was a bit of pain (unsure if this was because i was heavily pregnant) but nevertheless beautiful grounds and plenty of space to enjoy your stay.   I previously stayed at Riu Tikida Dunas with family and would recommend that if staying with family   ,5
"We have just come back from a wonderful 2 weeks at this hotel.  Everything was amazing, the hotel is huge. Staff are friendly and helpful,  the rooms very spacious and clean. Buffet restaurant had lots of nice food to choose from. I definitely want to go back.",5
"Upon arrival we had our usual welcome, so many of the staff were pleased to see us again as this was our 10th visit to this hotel. The food is very nice although a little samey. In the main restaurant we were always looked after by Marouane, Samira, Mohammed and Yassine and in the lunch restaurant it was Fatima, Karima, and Hanane. In both restaurants we always had to table ready for us. One of the managers, Brahim, helped us with a small problem. Two others that deserve mention are Tariq at the pool and Safae one of the cleaners  who always had a smile and kept the loos clean and sweet smelling.  The grounds are beautifully kept and cleaned on a regular basis every day.  The bar staff were always helpful and generally remembered what drinks we liked and kept them coming all…",4
"Excellent hotel, staff are very friendly and accommodating. Great food and drink with a wide variety of choices. Rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean. Pool area and gardens are well kept with comfy sun beds and private beach just outside the hotel gates. Great value for money and a lovely relaxing holiday, we’ll definitely be back!",5
It’s a beautiful hotel with great design and style. The rooms are large and comfortable. The staff are incredibly friendly and nice. We really enjoyed our stay here. I had an Arabic lesson from Abdel who was an excellent teacher and really nice lad. All in all it was a great holiday.,5
"We have been to this hotel numerous times,and we are very comfortable here, you will never receive a welcome like this anywhere else,the staff are very courteous and can't do enough for you. The manager,,Mr Brahim,,(man in lovely suits)told me that the hotel will be refurbished next year,and I think it really does need it,,looking a little tired and shabby in parts,,didn't stop us having a lovely holiday,,look forward to seeing the Palace once it is done.the saying is we will be back.Thank you Tikida Palace",5
"We have been visiting the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir since 2014, but this is the first time we have stayed since Covid.  After reading several negative reviews, especially regarding the food, we were worried standards had slipped and things had changed for the worse.  We have now returned from a weeks stay and are happy to report the hotel is every bit as good as we remember!  The food, service, rooms etc are all excellent and every bit as good.  Taking everything into consideration this hotel is 5-Star in my opinion. Sure, if you go looking for faults, I’m sure you will find some. However keep in mind where you are and the price you paid.  To quote that famous catchphrase… ""I'll be back"".",5
"Fantastic kitchen, fantastic services, excellent point in the city. Big pool, near beach with private sector for hotel`s visitors. alcohol is included in all inclusive.  In my opinion - it is not only 5*... it is 5* ultra all inclusive!",5
"WoW! I just wish I was still there! Sooo beautiful! The welcome! Food for us as we arrived late in the night. The staff, the rooms, the food is out of this world! One waiter,  Marouane was our favourite! You need to go! The staff at Palace Tikida make your holiday extra special. They are warm & friendly and always smiling. The pools are amazing! Soooo much space! No problems at all with getting the sunbeds we wanted. Very well maintained. The entertainment staff are fantastic too! A must is to join in the Aqua fitness at noon every day! Brilliant! I wish I could remember all their names ( Summer?) but let’s just say they are ALL brilliant at their jobs & seem to enjoy themselves. We had rooms 2023 & 2025 & the room service was just perfect.  Every day our rooms were made up.…",5
"We have just returned from a 7 night stay at the Riu Tikida Palace Agadir and wanted to share our thoughts. Prior to Covid, we had been regular visitors to the hotel & couldn't wait to get back.  However, even we couldn’t ignore all of the recent bad reviews about terrible food & upset stomach’s. We were getting worried that the hotel had taken a massive nosedive & gone completely downhill. Having spent a week at the hotel, we can wholeheartedly say it’s as good as it’s ever been. The food is fantastic. Beautiful fresh salads every lunch & dinner service. Tons of choice…..meats, fish, vegetarian, tagine etc…. If you experience an upset tummy, I’d say it’s more likely due to a change of food, over indulgence or too much sun. The hotel is clean. We never saw any mess / uncleared…",5
"Positives The staff are friendly and helpful Interior design is lovely   Gardens are very well maintained Large resort with a number of pools to choose from  Felt secure  Proximity to the beach   Negatives Food & beverage options are not great which is a pity - there are x3 restaurants (Moroccan, International, Steak) which require advanced booking and then a large shared buffet restaurant. The standard of food across all is mediocre at best and after a few nights, it felt repetitive and more of a chore to eat. Specifically Crystal (the international restaurant) is bizarre, the menu on the booking app is different to what you get offered at the table, we sat for 30 mins without anyone asking us if we wanted a drink (bearing in mind its a small restaurant and it wasn’t at…",3
"Just spent one week at this hotel, what an amazing hotel and staff. Spotlessly clean, amazing staff, and great selection of food. Staff very friendly and always there to help. One of the best holidays I have been to.",5
"Stayed here for a week in Sept 22.  First thing to say is it's not five star!  Having said that, it does have a lot of plus points.  The hotel building and gardens/pool area are lovely and the staff work really hard.  The rooms feel a bit dated and could do with a refresh. There was also a terrible damp/drains smell. The doors to the bathroom are slats. This looks dated but also attracts dust.  The room is not dirty, it just doesn't feel 100% clean.  There was no light over the bath/shower. The ceiling fan did not work. We requested a matress topper as the bed was a bit hard and received it without any problems.  The pool area was great, although you have to be up early to get a bed (as always people put towels down and then don't turn up til 4pm).  There is a lot of empty space…",4
Finally got here book late 2019 . But a small thing stopped us from coming then . This is 3 rd time we have been here . Really do like it Staff always very nice and helpful . Food fantastic covers most things . Maybe rooms getting a bit tiered maybe a up date wouldn’t go a miss . Can be a bit dark . Love sitting in the outside bar area upstairs late afternoon and have a drink nuts and olives and watch the sun go down . Highly recommend this hotel . ,5
"We've just returned from a two week holiday at the riu palace tikida, agadir.  I can honestly say that this is the best hotel we've ever stayed at. It's absolutely amazing,  from the beautiful bar area in reception,  the spotlessly clean restaurants with outstanding service,  the lovely food,  immaculately clean toilets,  and very hardworking staff.  The rooms are very nice,  if I could be picky I would say that robes should be provided in all rooms in  a 5* hotel but they're not.  I don't think I've ever received such excellent service. The wine is very good and the cocktails delicious.  The location of the hotel is fabulous,  and the sunsets are amazing.  We had room 2092 and it was lovely,  with very nice views (although we did pay extra for the view). Thank you for a lovely…",5
"Great hotel, staff fantastic I’ve been going to Riu’s for years and will carry on doing so.All their hotels are to very high standards which ever one you choose.As a riu member you also benefit from late check out and upgrade when possible so would advise anyone wanting to use Riu’s to become a member.",5
"I have edited my original review of this hotel from a 2star to a 4star for the following points:  Keep in mind we were a party of 11 people (6 adults 5 children)  My first night at the hotel was not a great and pleasant experience. Unfortunately, I was not helped with my luggage upon arrival at the hotel and the rooms were not up to a 5star standard. There was no slippers or robes, and there was no shower gel in the shower room. For dinner service I was not helped or guided to a table and neither were we offered drinks. We had to keep calling the waiters to our service for basic standard needs….  However…  Having made a formal complaint with the lovely general manager Ibrahim, he had made sure he took care of the rest of our stay. He quickly addressed the need for slippers in…",4
"Had this hotel booked and paid for for well over a year. We emailed the hotel 2 weeks before we was due to arrive, to enquire about a late check out on our departure day. The hotel emailed us back to say our booking had been cancelled. This turned out to have been cancelled in error by the hotel. They have now stopped replying to our emails and refuse to reinstate our booking, even though they still have rooms avalible. If you dont want to end up sleeping on the beach, book a diffrent hotel!",1
The rooms are great if you can get in. Every day I had to go to reception to get my room keys changed so I can get in. Had complained everytime and basically the staff didn't give a sh*t !!. This is the first Riu of many that I have stayed in and will never return because of this. All have had a dodgy stomach to .,4
"Just returned from a 10 night stay. This is definitely not a 5* hotel, maybe 3.5 or 4 at a push would be more accurate.  Positives: The pool and outside grounds are fantastically maintained. The lobby bar can make great off menu cocktails; the whole lobby is a lovely area to sit. The Moroccan and Krystal (except the disgusting foie gras on the menu - vile that this is on there) restaurants are wonderful. The staff are lovely. Quick to respond to issues raised on app.  Negatives: Every outdoor area is full of smokers. The terrace, the outside dining area, the pool area. Even the swim up pool bar doesn’t mind people smoking, even though there are signs to say no smoking. Ruins it for a non smoker. The pool is completely devoid of atmosphere. Having stayed in the Riu Palace Riviera…",2
"Trying to be as balanced as possible.  Not sure what passes for 5 star as never been to Morocco before but we think 4 star is more of a fair reflection.   We’re now in to our last 24 hours of our stay here and here’s our review of our holiday.  Reception staff; not overly helpful or friendly. When asking about booking a table it was a curt “ use the app”. Despite the app telling us the restaurants were full we walked past and they were half empty at the times we tried to book.  Also had card reprogrammed twice as it stopped working and we couldn’t get into our room, we spoke to other guests who had the same problem - some more times than us.  Otherwise service from staff throughout the hotel is outstanding. Very very friendly, welcoming and looked genuinely happy in their work.…",3
"Not a 5* hotel, at the very best a 4* Although the reception area is immaculate the rest of the hotel is looking tired, especially the rooms.  The variety of food is awful, after a couple of days both myself and husband were ill and spent the day on the toilet. After that all we ate was the chips and pizza!! Tui needs to rethink there rating for this hotel and stop taking peoples hard earned money advertising this as something it is quite clearly not!",2
Lovely food and hotel BUT nightly shows are ok and have seen and experienced far better in other Riu hotels .. however the female singer and guitarist are AMAZING.. lovely holiday and thank you Riu as always !,5
"Second time visiting this lovely hotel. Couldn't recommend it enough. The staff are amazing, especially the animation team who don't get recognised enough! Outman was one that stood out the most, he would always go out of his way, which I can't thank enough! Without the animation team the hotel would not be the same, they are always full of energy and ensuring guys have a wonderful stay! Will definitely return again because of them.",5
"Amazing hotel! The thing that makes this hotel is definitely the staff, especially animation team. Everyone puts in 100%, always happy to help with a smile on their face. Hamza in particular is very talented and makes the team what it is, without him and a few others the hotel would be boring.   Music in the evenings is nice but would be good if they changed it up as after 10pm it’s abit quiet and people want to enjoy their holiday and not go to bed. Food is lovely lots of variety. Absolutely love agadir and would definitely return!",5
"We came here back in May and loved it so much that we rebooked it for my birthday! The staff cannot do enough, the animation team can’t do more to make your trip the best it can be! Outman is definitely a name to remember and goes above and beyond to make you have the best holiday possible. Non-stop enthusiasm and always with smiles on their faces. I will 100% be returning because of the animation team and their dedication to their job to make all guests have the best possible holiday!",5
"I stayed at riu palace from September 1st until the 8th. The food & hotel was excellent, the animation team was brilliant as well. Jenna from the animation team stood out & always spoke & would help if you needed anything! Always had a smile on hir face. I would definitely stay at this hotel again 😊😊",5
"Excellent week away to the RUI palace.  Friendly family atmosphere.   The usual put your towels down but if your carefree you will always get a sun bed.  Great choice of food, could be a bit monotonous if staying for two weeks.  All in all we would definitely go back.  We had a wonderful room. ",5
One of the best chef pasta made by chef fatim zahra !! Well done for the great hospitality However the RIU kids experience was very bad  A lady called asmaa not trained neither qualified to be around kids  My autistic kid spend 8 days with wonderful staff there until friday when she shoed no interest which made me Leave the place  today Saturday 3 of sep 2022 Asmaa showed 0 energy 0 care as I was watching from the outside area  He was the only kid there and she had no interest rather than sitting on the reception chair with  Her phone 📱  I approached her with my opinion she had very bad attitude and finished the conversation with take care of him ( my son) Very bad experience to be honest,1
"Not a five star hotel. 4 star at best. Rooms are okay, bathrooms are tired & need renovating, pools are very nice, pool bars okay, but watered down beer then on the other hand the spirits served have more alcohol than mixers. Food in the hotel okay, but very repetitive, nothing to do at night we were bored out of her heads.I’m not going to go on & on, but my main gripe was on checkout. We checked out at 11 am, a few hours later my daughter realised she’d left a very expensive necklace in the bathroom, I immediately approached reception to tell them, the room had been cleaned & no one else had checked in so I asked for a card for the room to check, it wasn’t there. Reception asked the maid if she had seen it she said she hadn’t, rubbish !!!! The necklace was definitely in the…",3
"So my experience was good but it wasn't the best and didn't feel worth the price we paid or reflect the star rating.  The hotel itself is lovely and looks great but the standards in other areas weren't the best. The food is basically the same everyday with little changes each day but we got fed up of it as we just ended up eating the chips, pizza and pasta. The cups, plates and cutlery were quite dirty too and hard to find clean ones! We also hoped there would have been more choice in alcoholic drinks.  Staff are nice but there's a balance of good and bad. We faced a few members of staff who were not pleasant and quite rude although quite a few of them are lovely and very good at their jobs.   There were small issues with the room like the bathroom sink was blocked and broken…",2
"Upon arrival we were given a room that was not properly cleaned. The floor was not washed and it had hairs and marks of all kind. The room was right next to the street that gives access to Agadir beach and at 11pm there were was still too much noise for us to be able to sleep. We asked at the reception if it would be possible to change room and despite the late hour we were given a new room, cleaned and quitter.   Hygiene issues were constant. From cockroaches walking around the restaurant area and bathrooms, to the dirty aspect of the restaurant floors, there was this constant feeling of lack of training/care from the bars/restaurants staff. We had to repeat our requests for drinks 3/4 times, often the plates were taken from us without asking for permission and we always felt…",2
"Service - Slow and unorganised. Tables aren’t prepared and takes them a while to serve. Some staff were slow and ignored your presence.   Food - Food has little to no taste, I often didn’t eat much. Most of the buffet is not labelled and when you ask about ingredients even the chefs aren’t sure.  Difficult for vegetarians, especially with the lack of food label.  Drinks - Cocktails were awful, overloaded with syrup. I personally gave up drinking them. Training needed.   Cleanliness - Hotel exterior is maintained very well but restaurant cutlery was usually dirty with food stains and fingerprints. Staff move cutlery from one table to another.  Rooms - Nice size and design but toilet is dark and dingey. I asked for bed sheet change after being bitten by bugs several times and maid…",3
At best a 4-star. The location is nice but near a very busy public beach with a promenade. The rooms are nice but there are no toiletries (shampoo or conditioner). There were reported bugs in the bed in one of our rooms and no action was taken. Restaurant - Food was not labeled well and was often very confusing. They do not cater to vegetarians well or understand the meaning. The choice for vegetarians is poor and placed next to non-veg and we often noticed cross-contamination. The chef was rude and did not seem to care. The restaurant manager was the same. They seem to have been in the job too long and there needs to be a need for change. Cutlery was often dirty. Pool bar staff would serve males first and avoid serving a female. The cocktails were often hit and miss.,3
"Can someone who's stayed recently help.   We stayed in February 2022. For 11 days, in the central areas,  for 24 hours a day, the hotel played ""This is no ordinary love"" by Sade as background music, on continuous loop. It sent me around the bend.   Do they now play other background music or muzak or the same old Sade tune?",4
"We visited RUI Palace at the start of August and it was nothing less than superb! Large hotel complex, very friendly and helpful staff and good drink and food variety.  The entertainment team did an outstanding job, including everyone (not being pushy) to join in the activities. The shows in the evenings were of a high quality and one member of the team in particular, Jannat Dradi was fantastic with the children. She always had a big smile on her face and had a fantastic energy. I couldn't praise her enough, she should be managing the animation team.  Overall, the staff were lovely and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5
"What an AMAZING hotel!!  Beautiful from the moment you walk in!!  4 restaurants - all of which were absolutely first class! Food really was nothing short of fantastic!!  Main buffet restaurant has a mix of live cooking stations, Tagines, salads, dessert counters, all full of flavour and impeccably presented.  Then there is a pool / snack bar restaurant that doubles up as an Italian in the evening. Again, lunches were fantastic - fresh fish, steaks, salads, paella, pasta, all sorts.  There is then a fusion and a Moroccan restaurant. Top, TOP quality food and presentation!! (I’m a bit of a foody and these outlets were well up there with the kind of place you pay over £100 for you and a partner to dine in!)  And when they say all inclusive, there is no messing. No you need to pay…",5
"I would like to thanks the mini club team for there warm welcome to our kids , it was really very good experience  with lovely girls the responsable Miss sajida &jannat & khadija&dija, asma and fati thanks one more time for your professional and lovely service you made our stay very comfy 😊",5
We had great experience at this place we stayed in the early part of July and had great time from the time we check in to the last day from everyone .This place was very clean and had great restaurants with good food and the pool was magnificent and clean every one was very helpful and entertainment was excellent had a great time Unfortunately it had to end I would like to thank everyone for the great experience and I am sure will see you soon 😀 .,5
"Do not stay at this resort! Hotel is old, tired, desperately need in renovating/bull dozing, food is awful. Whole experience was horrific from our arrival and to such an extent we left after 2 days as we simply could no longer tolerate it.  Our issues included: - no assistance on arrival  - no towel vouchers that were treated like gold! - 1 x room was not prepared, dirty, towels on floor & 1 x room did not have beds set up for our young children  - breakfast restaurant is like a prison food hall, dirty, loud, tables not set, cutlery bent and food selection disgusting if replenished at all - sun beds hoarded by guests - beach heavying, no service/attendants, cigarette butts & camel dung everywhere  - stray cats all over the resort - drink selection vile  - safe not working,…",1
"Firstly TUI are an absolute joke taking money off people by selling this hotel as a 5 star because it’s not.  When complaining about being unable to book a restaurant due to it saying it’s closed on the App was told by reception staff that the hotel doesn’t like guests booking restaurants. When they did book for us we experienced the fastest ever service in the Moroccan restaurant; whilst still chewing on my main dish, plates were cleared and  deserts instantly served. After staff cleared our dessert plates our full wine glasses where then taken away as we were told to leave because they wanted to shut. The Italian restaurant is not an Italian, it’s a left over buffet restaurant from lunch. I can’t comment on the Crystal restaurant  as my symptoms developed and I was unwell with…",1
"Do not book this hotel if you are expecting a 5 star hotel with a private beach. Dreadful. Food, service and cleanliness is awful. Cross contamination in food area, food experience just a chaotic mess. Drinks poor, waited ages for any form of drink or glasses, never any water, cutlery, drinks or plates. Lunch buffet dreadful, broken dirty umbrellas, not enough space. If you want a sun bed you have to set an alarm. Can't get to the pool through sheer amount of crammed in beds. Gym area really poor, hardly any equipment, no water, no towels and no soap in the toilets by pool and gym for 4 days even though flagged to hotel. Quality of food poor and beach is horrendous, not private at all you can hardly access the sea through sheer amount of pitched up tents. Outside area not good…",2
"I would like to start off and say a massive thank you to everyone at the hotel for helping me enjoy every moment of my stay, and I couldn’t fault them. I have just returned home and have already been thinking about going back with my friends for a girls holiday. The entertainment team have been amazing. Always wanting to have a chat but remembering who you were to carry on a conversation or even wanting to get the most out of you by joining in activities so you are making the most out of your holiday. Also giving you nicknames which they would remember such as for me it was “G” or “George” which I love as that shows the effort into wanting to get to know you.  The darts were amazing and lots of fun ‘Mizou’ did a great job at this and has shown a lot of dedication into learning…",5
Staff can be so rude when order drinks near the pool. Rooms have bed mites. My nieces were covered with bites and when reported was told can’t be beds and probably be bitten outside. Restaurant manager completely didn’t care when told him that we are 12 vegetarian and why is meat being served  near vegetarian section. As some people just use vegetarian spoon for meat n cross contaminate vegi food. Some food was so bland no taste. When we ask the staff if vegetarian one says yes and another says no. Completely untrained staff..  Some of pool side bar staff completely doesn’t know how to make cocktails or simple cold coffee etc. Reception can be little be brighter and have a/c.,2
"Even arriving at 04.15 we received a warm welcome. Spacious rooms, excellent food, clean hotel, clean poolside and pool. Great animation team too. Friendly faces with smiles 24/7. No hesitation in recommending the hotel. I do wish though they policed the reserving poolside places. People left towels late at night or were getting up ridiculously early to reserve sunloungers that were never occupied until lunchtime.  ",5
"I went to the hotel as alone single parent with my daughter. Generally speaking couldn’t fault the hotel save for when either myself or my daughter needed something e.g a drink, they would serve males first and wait for no reason. As a female this became more upsetting on the holiday! Such a shame!",2
"We stayed for a week in August, our first time to Morocco!  Pros:  The hotel itself is stunning, rooms are spacious and have everything you could need.  The pool area is huge plenty of sunloungers but be prepared to wake up early to reserve the cabana beds (most days men were asleep on them saving for the family).  Being so close to the beach was a massive plus as you can walk along the promenade.  With TUI we booked a sand boarding experience it was 10/10 highly recommend!   Cons:  We found this hotel had no atmosphere throughout our stay, the entertainment team tried but it was very repetitive.  There was 1 speaker around the whole pool area so if you aren’t close there’s nothing going on.  For an all inclusive the drinks were awful. The cola was flat, a cup full of ice and…",2
"Booked for a family holiday, 5 adults and 2 children.  Rooms were lovely but 2 of the rooms were on the roadside and were extremely noisy.  Reception changed the rooms without any fuss.  The good bits- Rooms were spacious with lovely balcony. Had rails for handing wet swimsuits etc on. Balcony chairs great, Very comfortable beds with good air conditioning and a fan. Had kettle for the morning tea and soft drinks in the fridge.  The housekeeper did a grand job and the room was spotless. Pool clean albeit a little cold when you first get in. Pool towels nice and the sunbeds comfortable.  Good service at the pool bar and staff were friendly and even mixed me a drink I had previously had in another country.  Reception was nicely furnished with lots of comfy sofas. There are cats at…",3
"I’m currently staying here with my husband and son, we’re a week into our 2 week holiday and having a fantastic time, the hotel is stunning, the room is spacious and clean. The pools are great, even people sneak out early to put their towels down 🙄 we’ve always found some. All the staff are great, happy to help with anything and the food is really good.",5
"On arrival at the hotel it's a very beautiful place, really impressive. Check in was swift and restaurant was left open despite the late hour of check in. The rooms are large and spacious but our view was of a car park and our 14yr old son had a sofa to sleep on. We did request a bed for him which was delivered 2nd day but was very uncomfortable. Our bathroom had a bath bit was a bit rusty on the outside whereas our family was next door and had a nice refurbished shower room. The hotel grounds are very well kept and the swimming pool area well maintained.  Outside the hotel is not very nice, the private beach is not private, it's a roped off area on a very public beach and the moment you step out of the hotel you are harassed for money. The plus side of this hotel are the bar…",4
"My family and I (all adults) travelled to the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida Agadir on the 01st August 2022 for 10 nights. There are both positives and negatives. Unfortunately for us, the negatives do outweigh the positives, and means that we would not be rushing back!   Firstly.. the positives!   -Hotel grounds - absolutely beautiful, reception area is huge, plenty of places to sit, plenty of bars, and pool area really is beautiful.   -Animation team - This team are just AMAZING!! They made our holiday! So friendly, so energetic and so much going on! Shout out to Kadijya, Hamza, Outman, Anas, Yousef etc! Such brilliant people, you really did make our holiday brilliant! A range of different activities during the day, darts, water polo learning Arabic, petanque, aqua gym, yoga, bingo…",2
"On first impressions when walking into the lobby it’s very grand and impressive as you would expect for a 5*   Part of our package was the most basic room , when we arrived to our to it was very lovely and better than expected but when we went to our bathroom we were surprised as there was dirty towels on the floor, used toiletries on the sink and the bath was filled with water. We think that it had been used for people that have checked out and use the shower in rooms before they leave the hotel. We rang down to reception and they sent up housekeeping who just gave us extra towels.   We would have left it at that but in the morning we used the shower and the pressure was awful. So we spoke to the tui rep who got our rooms changed . When we changed rooms they had given us a…",3
"I would say this hotel is fantastic staff are welcoming, friendly and humble 10/10. The beach is right next to the walk. The swimming pool is great but it says don’t reserve sun beds but you will have to reserve sun beds early morning to get a good one. Entertainment staff are so friendly and chatty. The waitress are lovely always willing to help and get a seat for us for breakfast/lunch and dinner. I would recommend this hotel it’s been such a great experience my first all inclusive I would do it again !",5

Great night. Sarif & Seloine & Amal were fantastic accommodating wait staff. Window seats by pool was super fun. It was the perfect spot after a relaxing spa day next door at the hammam which was incredible.,5
"Great service! Sarif & Seloine & Amal were excellent. Sat on the couches overlooking the pool, great view and ambiance. Sweet spot for friends hanging. Food was hit and miss, wine too, but the experience of company in a beautiful and not too loud environment was worth it.",5

Long day traveling from Marrakech to Casablanca then Rabat. Checked in to the Sofitel Jardin Des Roses and wanted to find dinner close to the hotel. Went to the Golden Fish since it was at the hotel. Sat right next to the pool with relaxing water feature sound of spray into the pool. Very comfortable chairs and the sea bass was the best I’ve had in awhile! Great service too from Amal and Youssef! HIGHLY recommended!,5
"My stay at the hotel is memorable . The food is amazing and the service was amazing with them ladies in charge , SANAE , Fatima Ezohra and Oumaima.   For the room service and the cleaning , no complaint at all, everything was in check and extra well done with SANAA, Rachida and Hafida. The scent of cleanliness is priceless in this hotel!

I want to thank all the team at the Sofitel in Rabat. The service was outstanding. People are very kind and helpful. I particularly thank Hafida for looking after us. I recommend this hotel because of the guest relations including Zineb.,5
I was particularly charmed by the excellent service of the housekeeping staff (Housekeeping ladies Soukaina and Najat and supervisors Habiba and Zineb). I stayed in the hotel 19-21 September 2022. The housekeeping team showed me how to properly use my Nespresso coffee maker and even prepared a coffee for me. They also cleaned my shirt after I made stains on it.,5
"Beautiful hotel and gardens. Peaceful and relaxing. Breakfast was amazing. Nizar (reception) - incredible all around. Excellent service, thoughtful and accommodating, he was such a pleasure to work with. Younes (waiter at the Golden Fish) was also excellent. He made us feel so comfortable and taken care of at all times.  The entire breakfast buffet staff went out of their way to make sure we had what we needed.",4
"This hotel is ideally situated in Rabat, on a beautiful property near the gorgeous Andalusian gardens. Don’t skip out on the elaborate breakfast buffet that’s beautiful in itself and has amazing staff. Younes at the Golden Fish was incredibly accommodating and made us feel like family. Nizar in reception provided outstanding service to ensure we had a great stay. They and the breakfast buffet staff get 5 stars for their excellent service. There was a very strange incident with the front desk one night when they chased us into the elevator because they thought we weren’t registered to our hotel rooms (even though we had provided our room number to the hotel security). Overall, still a great stay.",4
"The hotel was very clean and tidy. Facilities were second to none. The staff were very friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. I stayed on the fourth floor and the the maids on that floor were amazing. I’d like to say a massive thank you to Najat, Sokia & Hahiba for making my stay so memorable.",5

She took care of our well-being during our whole stay, a very hardworking, pleasant and professional lady ! We ll definitely be back .",5
"I was surprised to find such a hiden gem restaurant ‘The Golden Fish’ in the corporate Sofitel in Rabat.   For meat lovers this has literally been the best fillet steak I have eaten in years. The service is fantastic led by an inspiring manager Soufiane and ABdessamad and Salic who prepared and cooked such a lovely meal.   Sadly I am here for four nights and have had the same meal every night.   But take my advice, if you are in Rabat and want a Michelin Star meal at a surprisingly low price come here. #Brilliant",5

"We were at the Sofitel in Rabat as part of a group tour that we booked with the Gate1 agency (our fave). This was the first hotel in our stay and it did not disappoint. We had a large and comfortable room, bathroom had a large shower; the bed was very comfy (king).   The bar staff was very friendly and the terrace was inviting; 2 musicians performing the two nights were there.   The highlight was the breakfast experience. The entire team was super attentive and the selection was second to none. The manager even came to our table to ensure everything was great (her name escapes me but she’s wonderful!)  Highly recommend.",5

"I had the great pleasure of an extended stay at Sofitel Rabat Morocco.  It boasts an excellent location right next to a lovely forest/park.  From the secured, gated entrance to the immaculately manicured grounds, the staff is courteous, attentive, helpful and accommodating.   The hotel meets the expectations of a 5 star designation. The delicious, varied and bountiful breakfast selections are not to be missed.  Hind prepares the most exquisite omelets while Malika provides excellent service.  The Harira soup is a delight.   I highly recommend the Spa and its Hammam.  It is an experience to not be missed and the perfect rejuvenation after a 14 hours flight. Overall, a top notch experience and my new home away from home for my business  trips to the lovely city of Rabat and the…",5

The service was awesome , Fatima Ezzahra & Sanaa were very friendly, attentive and helpful… they gave many recommendations with a smile on their faces , and this is exactly what we are missing nowadays, a SMILE does all the difference!! Same goes with Othmane, during lunchtime  at the terrace, he is just an incredible man who did everything to make that moment memorable sharing a very good vibes!! Those people are great and made my stay very enjoyable 🥰",5

They always have a smile on their face and speak to each guest as if they were family.  Their service is excellent.  The hotel grounds are beautiful and very well maintained.  I cannot say enough good things about the Sofitel Rabat.  I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Rabat!",5

All rooms have a good view either towards the sea or over the gardens and pool.",5

Today I checked in Sofitel Rabat for 3 nights paying for a Junior suite average of 400 Euros per night, I shall gain an upgrade to a better suite as platinum member and the gentleman in the reception told me I need to speak with my manage.  She declined stating no availability then I re-asked the receptionist that the application of all Accor is showing suite availability . I told them OK, do not do it as a gesture although this is not gesture as since there is availability they must upgrade me, so I asked them to deduct from my suite upgrade balance and upgrade this junior suite to a bigger suite, the receptionist again asked his manager to make the upgrade…",1

Service is always top quality, albeit the hotel interior and furniture is quite tired and needs a refresh.",4

The IT guys could not sort it out, however the Director for Restaurants, Youssuf) came up to my room, it was late at night, and he tried without success too.

We ate snacks and had drinks outside at the Amber bar, had an unbelievably wonderful dinner at Al Warda, and enjoyed the plentiful and fresh free breakfast buffet. (Don’t miss dinner at Al Warda. Foodies will be impressed!) Service was great at the restaurants. Pools were immaculate and the service was great by the pool. It was strange that there was no food delivery option by the pool.
