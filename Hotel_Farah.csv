"The room, including bathroom, was tired and dated. There was no plug for the bathroom sink, human hairs in bath plughole and the towels were threadbare. We discovered a 2"" hatpin on the bedroom floor (nasty). The TV had only five channels working with poor aerial reception. The dining room food (evening dinner and breakfast) was average.",3
"I can assure you guys 100% this hotel is a con, they are just using there old history to display that they are 5 star. There rooms. Services. Facilities food is of max 3 star, I have been to uncountable 5 star hotels and this is not a 5 star. The person working there also admitted this and dose not want his name to be mentioned. He also said that with corruption and bride anything is possible.   Please do not go here it’s a 3 star hotel and not a 5 star one",1
"We arrived from Meknes, my son booked him, the location and the exterior called for me to stop looking for someone else, I missed my son and after a few minutes I saw him with someone who introduced me to him (Noureddine) and that he saw him as a suitable room, we booked him for 3 nights, the view was partly on the sea and on A crossroads and a city train, the furniture is old and worn out, and the worst is a bad smell coming from the bathroom that we didn't know where it came from, the breakfast was good, the cleaning women were friendly, the type of hotel that can't be remembered!",4
Great location. Our room was clean and the bed comfortable.  The staff was helpful and friendly.   My only complaint is that there were no soda or snack machines — the small gift shop did not have sodas or water.,5
The rooms smell musty and are dirty. The beds are horrible and the service is worse.  I can not with a good conscience recommend this hotel to anyone.  They claim to be a five star hotel but there is nothing five star about this place. ,1
"the worst hotel i have been in Morocco, the rooms have a bad smell, the furnishings are ugly and old. the restaurant room is really ugly and little, the best thing were the wine bar and  the singer's show :)",3
This is an older property but the location is good. Across from the Medina. The restaurant is over priced and variety on the breakfast buffet is okay and not what I am used to. For the money it’s okay. The Italian restaurant is a better deal got 2 pizzas ( made fresh and tasty ) for 160 Dhm’s. Night view of hotel from our window. The wall is the Medina wall.,3
Hotel was attractive looking and rooms were nicely decorated and a decent size but musty smell made this hotel less than desirable. Location was excellent with easy walk to medina and riverfront. Food was blah and way over priced.,3
"This was my first stop in Morocco. I think all the people on my tour that were meeting at the Casablanca airport, were very happy to arrive here after about 1 1/4 hour drive. The staff was very efficient and welcoming. The lobby area near the restaurant and bar was comfortable and inviting. My room was clean and fine, but rather dark. It was easy to walk to restaurants nearby. The only bad thing about this hotel was the breakfast. As westerners, we all thought it was lacking. ",4
"Room had  musky scent. A/C controls did not operate. Breakfast was poor and under catered for the number of guests. At dinner I asked for a red wine & a beer from a male waiter who seemed to resent my asking as if it was beneath him. I waited so long that I asked again,this time to a female waiter who took no time to respond. After the meal the male waiter asked for payment and I paid him with notes which he put in his pocket, which I thought odd as no receipt was offered. I chatted to other travellers then proceeded to my room only to be pursued by the female waiter for payment of drinks.I pointed to the other waiter & explained he put my payment in his pocket. I reported this incident to the desk the following morning.",4
"The hotel requires some serious TLC, very outdated. Upon our arrival our room had no power and it took 3 visits to reception to get someone to come and take a look, it turn out the cleaner had tripped the fuse box, clearly the do not have follow up supervisor. The bathroom smelt of mould and their was a dirty smelly toilet brush propped up in the corner by the toilet. The food was mediocre and fairly bland. the biggest complaint would be about the staff, the restaurant manager was surly and unhelpful and the girls waiting on tables behaved as if they were doing us a favour and any request we made was an inconvenience to them. I would not recommend this hotel. Right by a busy roundabout and the traffic is continuous.",2
"This hotel requires major updates. Not sure how it qualifies as 5 stars - no iron, not working safe, very old furniture and molded ceiling in the bathroom.  Pretty nice lobby sitting area and location overall.",3
"Pleasantly located in a high hill area overlooking the beaches, if you get a room facing the sea then it will be a nice room so make sure to book right. The Medina is very close by is great for a day. Rooms are ok but the gym is the worst i have ever seen so far, trully, nothing works! 2 trademills, 2 bikes, no weights, horrible for a work out! regardless a nice little pool on the top floor with few tables around. Location is good. Staff is trying hard but still under level.",3
"This hotel is located 20 min from the airport. It has excellent location, walking distance to main attractions. Shops, restaurants, coffee shops, supermarket...everything is walking distance. Hotel is quite old, nothing special. Rooms are comfortable and clean, old furniture. I got a suite room, with huge living room which I did not use at all. Bathroom is large, with basic amenities. Breakfast is average, basic hot meals and lots of pastry and bread. Coffee could improve. Lovely view from the room if you are facing the front of the hotel but might be noisy due to traffic. Overall, good hotel for tourist if you wanna walk around Rabat and enjoy it. Money exchange just behind the hotel if you don't want to use the hotel one ",4
"The view from the terrace was the feature I like the must because I only spent one night, but it was good enough for appreciate certain things. The lobby is enticing, they have a saloon where you can relax, they have alive music at night which is very nice of them. The room I find it small but you can rest in silence. Nevertheless the terrace I found it astounding because you can take a look at the bright of thousands beaming lights around the city including the monastery. There's is like a park across the hotel where you can spent a pleasure time just by walking and watch the people gathered and sharing in family in the tranquillity of a safe city, at least that part of the city (I think the whole country is safe).",3
"We were part of a tour group starting at this hotel. The front desk staff were not at all friendly, welcoming or courteous. When we approached them with a question they would pass you off to another staff member and they wouldn't help you either. The upside of the hotel was the room attendant. She was the kindest and most helpful. The room itself was okay but carpeting seemed damp and musty. The location is central to everything and that's a plus. The tram station is right outside the front door and is easily accessible. ",2
The location is good close to all activities. Staff are good. Hotel needs full maintenance. For example I had to go three times to reception to change room key and didn’t work. You can feel smell all over and spots on pillows and bed covers. I think the hotel rate shouldn’t be more than three stars.,2
We are here as part of a group tour and so far have not had the best experience. After 16 plus hours of travel you’d expect a better welcome. No one at check in counter explained how long it would be until we get a room and what to do in the interim. We were directed to an atrium/lounge area which reeks of smoke. Definitely don’t recommend.,1
"the reviews i had read about this hotel before i went to Rabat have changed. the hotel is super clean, beds are comfortable, staff are super friendly and helpful, buffet is varied and food is delicious, location in a very nice area, only 5 minutes walking to old Medina souks, Hassan Tour and many other touristic spots. it has a lovely lobby with a nice ambiance. it has a shop where you can find many things, daily needs and souvenirs  the hotel is quiet and the views from the top are amazing. i highly recommend it and i would only suggest that they think about renewing some bed frames soon",5
I stayed in Farah Hotel for more then 4 nights and it was very comfortable. I advis it for business trip because it's moderate and you feel home. The Rooms are good despite that it's old and a little bit of noise for the rooms in front of the street. The Hotel have a parking which really helps.The breakfast is very good and tasty. The Hotel has an amazing situation near the Medina and near the Tour Hassan.,4
The dinner was excellent the hotel is amazing and the staff super all of them has so many beautiful views from the terrace 5th floor  The room big and so clean the bathroom is very good with good toiletries ,5
"We stayed at the Farah Rabat Hotel for three nights as part of a group.  The staff was very accommodating, but the hotel is showing its age.  The whole second floor smelled moldy and almost a sewage like smell in the room that almost made me sick.  The AC was noisy and we had to turn it off.  Although the room was clean, the wood furniture was nicked and old.  I lifted up the mattress to check for bed bugs - and the box spring was disgustingly stained.  We had a buffet dinner in the restaurant - food was average and they ran out of desserts.  Breakfast was the same each day - no prepared on demand food, just steam table stuff.  They ran out of orange juice and coffee cups.  Clearly not paying attention to detail!  The only positive part of the hotel is that it is convenient to…",2
"good service, front desk manager amazing. Room (323) had torn chairs and we were charged for an execuitive room that was the same as a regular room occupied by a friend. Breakfast was ok and the room in general reminded me of a rmada or holiday inn",2
"Nice hotel, spacious room  clean n very nice setting. Unfortunately the swimming pool is on the maintenance. Great place to stay.  Nice restaurant for breakfast n dinner, buffet, Small variety. Will comeback  for the next visit.",4
I was booked into this hotel for work during the Hassan trophy (Golf tournament). During my stay I asked reception if they could do laundry here. To which they replied yes and I gave them a plastic bag of washing. That evening I received my washing back and the following day i went to pay. And was shown a bill for 2000 dirham (€200). The lady behind reception proceeded to laugh in my face and say it's expensive to do washing in the hotel and told me I had to pay for it. I on two occasions went to talk to the reception about the matter and was told that the person was not here till later. Was told the person would be there in the morning of the checkout but alas no. I was forced to pay with nothing on the bill changed.  The food for the breakfast was ordinary and only ok if you…,1
This is no better than a 1 star hotel and on top of the breakfast was horrible. I would never have booked it - Gate 1 travels booked it for me. The only positive thing is it is close to downtown - a short 10 min walk,2
"This is a shocking experience for me. Our room is beyond hygiene standards and we have asked to move room several times but reception staff is completely ignorant and does not understand issues. We had 1 towel, shower broken, toilet not working well and airco horrible condition ",1
the service at this hotel was pretty bad. I had no internet in the room and when I asked the front desk staff they were not too helpful. In fact the whole experience with hotel personel (front desk and one person at bar) was very unpleasant. You get the impression that they want you to go away and not bother them. I would go to the main bar/lobby to consult my email.. but then the smoke there is unbearable. My experience with was not a great one. they get 5 stars for poor service.,2
"After reading the comments on Tripadvisor, I decided to take along some bug spray-just in case we had an investation of ants or roaches on our first night in Morocco. Fortunately, we did not. That said, we found the hotel to be very average in decor, worn in places and quite unappealing in others. The breakfast buffet offered a variety of items and was definitely the best thing about our stay in the hotel. Another aspect which proved excellent was the location near the Medina. We were with a tour group. Otherwise I would have chosen a different hotel for our stay in Rabat.",3
"An hotel that would get barely 3 stars in any country, has given itself (I presume) 5. No soul, very average food, super old furniture with signs of the time. Only high note the service that is good and the customer service. Nothing else to save.",2
"As others have pointed out, this hotel is pretty tired, requiring rather a lot of maintenance, broken light bulbs and fixtures. Aircon not working, but window opens, albeit onto a very noisy road. The latter can’t really be helped because of its position. Take your life in your hands crossing the road - a little green man means nothing! As to the towels...grey, grey, grey, hard, hard, hard. They desperately need replacing. I travelled with a singles group so the hotel was not one of my choice. However, on the plus side, my double room was very spacious with 2 very large single beds and flat screen tv. The room was clean and kept that way. Be aware that there is no free water or coffee making facilities. Also, if paying with cash at either of the bars, they have real issues…",3
"I've honestly never stayed anywhere in the world that was so bad that I felt compelled to write a negative review...until this hotel in Rabat.  And, honestly, had this hotel been described as a 2-3 star hotel from the start, at least my expectations would have been more in line with what I actually received.  It still would have been a bad experience, but at least I would have been set up to not expect much to begin with, so the disparity between the two might not have been as great.  But to bill this place as ""5 star"" is an outright lie.  You may be thinking: sure, maybe by ""your/western"" standards, this wasn't ""5 star,"" but perhaps by ""Morocco standards"" this is 5 stars.  Let me just say this: during my time in Morocco, I stayed in 6 other hotels besides this one (this would…",1
Upon my Rrival in Rabat... hotel with roof top terrace with best view in town of Hassan Mausoleum and Sale with Oued River... optimum service... beer 50dh!! Terrace with pool... they welcome you like a sultan! Did not stay at hotel.,5
"Absolutely terrible, avoid this hotel.  It is owned by a Kuwait investment firm who have been trying to sell it (and 8 others in the same chain) for several years.  Golden Tulip used to operate it, they ended their contract because the owners would not reinvest to keep up the standards.  Rooms are decrepit, furniture is old and damaged, electrical outlets do not work, half the lights in the hallways and some lights in the rooms do not work.  Cleanliness is very poor, with ant infestations in the bathrooms.  It is located at a very busy intersection downtown, and traffic noise is present H24.  This hotel is a disaster, to be avoided at all costs.",1
"My husband and I booked a tour in Morocco and tried to make a reservation in this hotel since we would arrive in Rabat one day in advance, as this was the same hotel our tour had picked for the first two nights. Unfortunately (or fortunately) for some reason its website booked in Farah Marrakesh instead of Farah Rabat and even after explaining the situation to the personnel, they never understood it and ended up cancelling our reservation instead of offering a solution to move it to Rabat after stating the error was ours without reviewing the booking section of their site, so we had to stay in a small hotel (more like a B&B) which btw was GREAT. After arriving in Rabat the next day we received good service from the staff and got a spacious room with a great view, but the problem…",2
This is a hotel run by an uncommitted management of hotel excellence. Everything one ask for is not responded to and they seem to be operating on groups so they don’t cater to personal needs. Definitely not to be repeated.,2
"We stayed in this hotel as part of a tour. We were sold this hotel as a 5*, but it’s not. The entrance and lobby are nice but rooms and restaurant are standard. Restaurant has buffet dinner, nothing special. ",3
I have major issues with the hotels classification in Morocco in general. This one is definitely not a 5 star from any angle. Room had aging furniture with questionable heating/cooling system. I had half board so tried both their dinner and breakfast and to be honest wasn't impressed at all. No bottled water in the room and no coffee/ tea facilities either. I wouldn't stay here again.,3
"I cannot believe One Traveller tour company passes this hotel as 5*.....this is a joke. The staff are so unfriendly. the duty manager Mr Abdul decided to charge me extra money if I wanted cheese  at the end of dinner. No water in the rooms, nothing in the mini bar all rooms are dark and dismal, broken dark brown furniture. Worst hotel in Morocco. Aviod at all costs.",2
"This place stinks.  Literally.  The first room we got was so smelly of mold and mildew that we requested another room.  We soon realized that the stairways smelled, the hallways smelled, and the rooms smelled of mildew.  The restaurant did not smell, to be fair.  And breakfast was admittedly good.  But I would not stay again.",2
The worst hotel I have been. Not even two stars. The rooms are not clean even there is not any glass or complimentry water. Minibar is empty. The receptionists are unhelpful and unrespectful. I never advice for anyone to stay this hotel.,1
This hotel had the basic American style amenities. The shower was hot with good water pressure. The beds were comfortable but small. The food was bland basic American style food. They did not have coffee with dinner.  The lounge was nice and they served alcohol. It is close to everything. Beautiful city. ,3
"Great location is the only reason why you may consider staying here. You can walk to the Muhammad place and the Medina...  BUT bear in mind you may have to deal with the folloiwngs! 1. RUDE FEMALE PERMANENT STAFF. as soon as I walked into the hotel to check in, the female hotel staff pretended she did not understand what I said and just kept yelling at me until I asked for her name, then she react better and understood me all of a sudden. Other than that, the door staff and the interns were super nice and kind and ready to help. Sophiane was the intern who took the time to explain how to get around the city which was very helpful to me. Kudos to Sophiane for his helpfulness and knowledgable advice.  2. The place is very old and dirty. I walked into the room which smelled like…",2
"An over rated and disappointing hotel. Has a very good location. Rooms are in need of refurbishing and cleanliness is an issue for a hotel that purports to be a 5 star. Insects and hair!  The front desk is indifferent to its guests, although the bellman and door staff worked hard to get taxis and bags where they needed to be. Breakfast room is crowded and not well maintained, but choices were plentiful and interesting. There must bebetter choices at this level in Rabat.",3
"Very bad experience on a very bad hotel, Very bad customer service and staff are ignoring everything you need. I don't know how it cosidered 5 stars hotel.  I will never recommend it to anyone .  Shame on you.",1
Clearly the hotel has seen better days. Rooms were dusty and the air conditioning made me sick. The rooms are adequate but definitely not 5 star. The hotel is well located to most tourist spots and to businesses. The staff were as helpful as they could be. I probably wouldn't stay here again.,3
very good food   big swimingpool  the hotel is near the travelsee the room we gat it was   the service in the resturenty 100 and in the hotel there is some store and not expenciveon the swimingpool  lareg room very good bath room,5
"I stayed in the Farah Hotel for a few days on business.  The location is great, overlooking the estuary and with great views over the city and towards the Hassan Tower and Mausoleum of Mohammed V.  Sitting on the roof terrace with a drink as evening fell was magical.  But my room (at the back of the hotel, so no view) was shabby, and much in need of an overhaul.  Towels were old and thin, and there were minimal toiletries.  And there was no information pack in the room, so it was a couple of days before I discovered the roof terrace.  On the plus side, the staff were friendly and attentive.  Breakfast was OK if not outstanding, with a reasonable selection of local and international items.  Overall I felt that, if the bedrooms were refurbished, the hotel could be turned from…",3
"The hotel is OK, but not a real 5 star hotel. However rooms are spacious, bathroom small but fine. The restaurant is also not bad. Staff is quite friendly and servie is correct. Breakfast is also quite satisfactory.",3
"I stayed at the hotel for one night on business.  After a busy week I was looking forward to a meal in the restaurant.  Although there appeared to available tables, much to my surprise I was ushered away to the Italian restaurant - which was completely empty and I was the only one there for over an hour.  I can only guess that the hotel favours the people booking in from large coach parties rather than local business people.    My room had very noisy air conditioning, but being a very warm night I had to leave it on.",2
"I came to this hotel with my family on a guided tour from the portuguese travel agency Abreu. We paid an extra to stay only in five star hotels. This hotel is not even worth 2 stars. My room had a Layer of dust, stains on the walls and the lamps, the tufted chairs were dirty and looked like they haven't been changed in forever,just like everything else. I will attach pictures to show what I meant. Disgusting.",1
"Il Farah Rabat Hotel (ex Golden Tulip Farah) is a luxury 5-stars hotel in Rabat, capital of Morocco and one of the four imperial cities.  I stayed here one night during my “imperial cities tour” and It was fine.  Surely you can not consider it a real 5 star (3-star is the real level) but it’s not bad: the rooms are clean and spacious, bathroom is small but equipped with courtesy kit and other comforts such as phon, double towels etc. The restaurant with international cuisine is not bad, definitely better than many other places where I ate in Morocco although much to improve.  Breakfast is very basic with yogurt, fruit juices, pastry and fruit, nothing special.  The hotel has a small pool on the panoramic terrace, with a bar where you can drink something!  Overall it's a good…",3
I stied at the hotel for four nigths this month as i was on a vacation. You can't realy say its a 5 stars hotel. I was disaompointed as i was expecting the food and the service to be a good as in the 5 stars hotels ,2
I was in this hotel in mid July for 4 nights and I can say there is no way you can say this is five star hotel check in time I was just standing on reception but the staff was busy doing something on computer and completely ignored me no sleepers in the room no iron or ironing board mini bar was completely empty they don’t have sleepers at all and no shoe shiner  No service and furniture in lobby or rooms are warn out I am strongly not recommending this hotel to any one ,1
"I spent 4 nights at the hotel. I wanted to move out the first night but all the hotels in Rabat were full due to the festival.   The only good thing about the hotel was its central location.  The bedsheets in the room were dirty.  The phone was dirty.  There was a horrible smell in the room.  The bed was uncomfortable.   I found a pin on the floor next to the bed.  The furniture is very old.  The reception is understaffed.  The operaters never answer the phone and when they do, they don't speak English and their Arabic isn't understood.   The food is horrible, even the boiled eggs weren't cooked well during breakfast.  The conference room was very gloomy.  The whole hotel didn't have a single prayer mat when requested.   It took the hotel staff 10 hours to deliver an iron +…",1
I recently stayed at this hotel which was provided by my work. This was my first time visiting Rabat and I was excited to visit the country. When I first arrived at my room I noticed that it was next door to the elevator which was annoying because I just arrived from an 8hr flight and the noise from the elevator was very loud. I went downstairs to reception and asked if it was possible to change room. I give my key card to one of the girls at reception and her response was very negative. She then passed me on to the lady that assigned me the room key. The other lady was not helpful either she stated that I would have to wait 1 hour to receive another room because one was not available. Disappointed I returned back to my room and waited for 45mins in the room I notice that the…,2
Busy international hotel. Stayed here for a conference and it was fine. Room was perfectly acceptable.  Highlights were the comprehensive international breakfast buffet and the excellent location for exploring Rabat.,4
"This hotel is very well located for visiting historic Rabat and rooms to the front view over Sale, the river, the medina and in the distance the sea.  I had an enormous suite with space enough for a party, clean, comfortable and generally very well appointed.  Ate here for breakfast and dinner and it was fine.",4
"Was via Gate1 group.  The hotel was clean and well located, right outside media on one side and within walking distance from shops, galleries and restaurants on the other side.  While the staff was courteous.  The hotel couldn't seem to handle the breakfast.  Ran out of cups, plates, food, and uncooked eggs.",3
"The hotel is adequate and the breakfast was good.  Try to get a room at the front of the hotel and not the rear where you don't have any decent view.  The staff was great and the pool area was a nice place to enjoy an evening drink; yes, the hotel does serve alcohol.  The big pull for this hotel is the location; you're next to the Medina and other sites and there is a Tram station very close by.  There are plenty of restaurants nearby that are cheap or expensive, depending on your tastes.  The only issue I had with the hotel was the female bar staff - very aloof and does a great job ignoring guests.  Would recommend this hotel.",3
"Joined a tour group and among all the hotels we stayed in from Casablanca, Rabat, Fes and Marrakesh, this is probably the best.  Old-fashioned rooms but spacious and well maintained. Bed was comfortable. Lobby and restaurants are well lighted. Even the hallways doesn't look creepy compared to the other hotels we stayed in.  We didn't have to fight for seats at the restaurant for breakfast and dinner. Food was above average.   Overall good stay and if ever I'll return there, I would want to stay here again.",4
"The hotel is located very conveniently in close walking proximity of the Mausoleum and Chellah as well as across the street from the old city Medina - excellent in terms of location, The Staff is really great and also going out of their way to help. The hotel is an old hotel which has been partially upgraded but in a slipshod and cheap way. Rooms are large and bathrooms work. The whole place really does need a classy redo but it all works. It is very livable and it is in the center of everything. There is a lot of traffic noise.",3
"Nice room, comfortable bed, excellent wifi connection. Great shower.  Safe in the room did not work. Good breakfast and dinner buffet. Nice service. Located within 5 minutes walk to the Hassan Tower and Mausoleum.",4
"This hotel is a perfect choice if you want to be in the centre of touristic spots, as it is within about five minutes walking distance to Hassan tower, the famous Mausoleum and the wall of the Medina (old City). The staff was good and the room was okay with nice choice of pillows and the bed was comfortable. ",4
"I and my wife stay in this hotel, my booking is call Hôtel Farah Rabat.   Had a very eye opening lobby. We had the dinner buffet at the hotel. Breakfast is inclusive.  Set in a Moorish-inspired whitewashed building, this hotel is a 5-minute walk from the 12th-century Hassan Tower.   With Wi-Fi.  Opposite it seem like Medina (old town area), as I can see the high medina wall.",4
"Central location, but very dated. Sheets don't fit bed, towels are threadbare. Service in restaurant is deplorable.    Nice view of city in early morning.  Would not stay here again or recommend any others do.",2
"Centrally  located , clean rooms, very courteous and helpful staff. Property Needs updating. Has a small bar & restaurant. Good breakfast & wonderful roof top bar & spectacular view of the city at night.would recommend for couple days.",4
"Pulled in yesterday as part of a small tour group. Only to be met by throngs of people also checking in. The hotel needs a major revamp. Shocking to think they would market this dump as a 5 star hotel. The Aircon in my room wasn't working. I was told to open my window without as much as an apology. No bottled water in the room and mini bar completely empty. WiFi basically non-functioning. Not even in the lobby. Room service, but without menu. You phone and they try to guess what you want.   Staff not very helpful, probably due to the hundreds of people milling around. This has been a truelly disappointing experience. Luckily only here for one night. ",2
This hotel is firstly in need of a major renovation. It is full our tour groups as they literally pull in by the buses. I would not stay here again even though it is very central. There has to be a better option,3
I stayed here while on a bus tour.  This is a large hotel which caters mainly for tour groups so there are always people coming and going.  The rooms are a fair size but most things in the room could be spruced up.  We had no soap in the bathroom and had to ask several times for staff to bring us soap.  The air con doesn't work very well so they room are rather hot and stuffy.  In order to cool down the room you need to open the window but then you assailed with a heavy traffic noise.  The dinner and breakfast buffet is fai.  In my mind this hotel is not up to 5* rating.,3
"Styled as 5 star hotel but in my view no better than a 3 star.   Rooms do not have beverage facilities. Aircon is rowdy and rooms have a funny smell. But after nearly 20 hours in the air, almost any bed will do.   Water in the restaurant is 35Dhs for 1.5 litres. Food quality was good....But this is on the first day. Will update on exit.  Wonder what the other hotels are like...next stop is Fez in a few days.",3
"This hotel is located right across the street from the Rabat Medina.   Rated a 5 star but this hotel is in need of an overhaul as it’s looking very worn.    A lot of tour groups/buses stay here so that adds to the turnover and feeling like a commodity.   The rooms are decent size but amenities are limited.   There are no wash clothes in the bathroom, no complimentary water and the towels are very worn along with the bathrobes.   We were greeted in the bathroom with a dead rose in a vase on the sink (which we promptly threw in trash bin).     Note that the shower requires you to step over a very high bathtub edge which could present difficulties if you are unstable or have bad knees as there are no grab bars.   The rooms were very warm even with heat completely turned off so…",3
"The furnishing in the room looks worn and tired. Although the room looks clean, the shower curtain looks dirty and worn.  However the room is spacious.  The air-conditioning cannot be on and the room is a bit stuffy. Opening the windows bring in fresh air but also the noise from the traffic on the road. My room faces the main road and the river.  From the room I get a good view of the Sale cityscape across the river.  Buffet dinner is reasonably good. I specially like the beef stew.",3
Hi All  Do not be deceived by the 5 star rating.   The decor in the rooms are outdated and the furniture is discolored. The bathroom shower head did not work and the walls are faded and dirty.   The staff is exceptionally rude and the elevator/lifts do not work properly.  Also Atlas Voyagers are using them which is a disgrace. For A reputable company they should know better.   Breakfast and dinner and decent but staff on restaurant not attentive and courteous.  Please see pictures of the room. ,1
A clean hotel in rabat but badly needs redecoration refurbishing. All the furnitures are quite old and run-down. There is nothing in the minibar either. But the bed and the bathroom is clean and fine. There is a safe box in the rooms. Breakfast is basic and  fine. The main lobby is clean but has seen better days,3
"I had to stay here for a conference, the hotel is dated, the carpets are stained, the A/C doesn't work, and the staff isn't very helpful. Each morning I tried to workout, the treadmills don't work, so I ended up doing a workout on the rooftop on my own. The laundry service changed the figures on my laundry submission to more than double what I had signed for. I was told I had inclusive breakfast, then once I ate it, I was required to pay. I now see on my credit card statement that they also charged me 62$ twice for something, but I'm unclear what that is. They didn't leave water in the room after the first day. I'm not impressed, particularly because it was expensive, and the food and room service was very expensive for what it was. ",1
"Dated hotel in need of a refurb  Hotel classes itself as four star but doesn't even have iron or ironing boards in the room   Room service is a rip off about £6 for a litre of water. We had pasta late at night and came cold and they didn't do anything to change it was just told ""ok"" chips were undercooked and cold. Breakfast isn't great.   Hotel is more a low end 3 star ",2
"This hotel is in need of a complete refit and re-decoration. Not comfortable at all. The food was fair, buffet style but lacked supervision to ensure the food was replaced with fresh at regular intervals. Eggs need to be freshly cooked not left to cool and congeal in large containers.  The best part of the hotel was the pool.",3
"My stay here was not by choice; I was assigned this hotel for a business trip. While the location is admittedly good and most of the staff were kind and helpful, there is so much wrong with the hotel itself, I would never stay here again. Here is a list of issues we had during our 7 day stay:  1. There were several flies and other flying insects in our room on arrival.  2. The sink would not drain starting on day one. It took two calls to the front desk and two separate maintenance visits over two days to get it fixed.  3. The tub did not drain. We finally just pulled the entire piece out of the drain.  4. The lamp, dresser, safe, and luggage rack were all broken.  5. The cleaning staff left the window open daily and with out a screen, also let in many bugs.  6. The room was in…",1
"The hospitality here is great. I was received by the concierge from the car to the lobby and taken to the room where my luggage was brought up right after. The room was good and spacious (since i was alone) but they can do better with more modern interior designs. Ths lobby is amazing together with the rooftop bar which are great places for one to unwind.  the staff were oohh so very warm and welcoming. My room had a leakage and once I reported it was sorted when i was having dinner.  I enjoyed my stay, good breakfast, but they dinner can be better.  Keep up the great hospitality and warm nature.",4
"Unless you booked a cheap bus trip to Marocco, this is not a hotel for you.   All you can do is run!  Room mediocre. Breakfast to be skipped as it's not worth even showing up.   Reception more like you have entered a corner cafe! Takes lots of time and efficiency is not part of their vocabulary.   House keeping us cleaned by ladies without shoes. That does indicate that we don't expect hygiene is high on the list.   Management is also clearly not interested in running a hotel at an acceptable level.   Carpets on I front of my room must have experienced a huge problem. I can't describe what I believe happened, but I don't think that a car had a motor oil leak.   I asked for a reduction of my room price as I experienced the above. I was blatantly told ""no way"".   Just run!!!",1
Very friendly staff and nice clean rooms. The city can be noisy and congested and this hotel offers a place to come to rest. Pool/bar and restaurant on the roof give nice view of the surrounding city. Walking distance of some nice points of interest.,5
It was enjoyable staying at this clean hotel for three nights. My room was quite spacious. I could hear some traffic from the street outside but not disturbing. Breakfast offered a great variety of options. Few English TV channels available. Reception attendants were helpful except when I asked for assistance in finding a taxi. I had to take to the streets myself.,4
"the location is perfect; just 200 meters from Hassan Tower and mausoleum of Mohammed V 1.6 km from Kasbah of the Udayas, and its better so its quiet erea. the service was very good the facility are old, you will see it almost all over Morocco, the not taking care about maintenance. the room was big and all was good for this price in the morning you will wake up from the whistle of the police man on the near junction I realy recommend this hotel, the location and the price are excellent the parking is real and not on the street, and it's free of charge  I prefer hotel out side from the kasbah or madina, I didn't feel safe there and the noise and the smell over there.",5
The hotel is nice. Great food and friendly staff. Some rooms has a very nice view of the sea and the city. Rooms are neat and clean but the furniture is old and the wifi is so slow. Other than that i always enjoy staying there i,4
"This hotel was rather dated and judging from the wear and tear of the room, it is due for an update.  It was clean though. The lobby was rather crowded, mostly because I believe, lots of tour groups use this hotel.  We were strongly cautioned to be extra careful of our belongings.  This caution resulted from a recent incident of theft at the hotel.  The food was rather good actually (breakfast and dinner) - that was why the hotel did not get a poor rating. Would rather go to another hotel if there was a better one but I was part of a travel group and did not have a choice.  Also, I did not see any other hotels in the area.",3
"Stayed here 4 nights for business.  Reservation was made for me so I checked out reviews before I stayed.  I usually try to have something positive to say about a hotel so here goes:  Pros: Room size was decent There was one English movie channel(15) which was a welcome change! Front desk staff speak good English Lobby area is updated with a contemporary lounge area  Cons: - Like others stated the rooms are dated.  Furniture is visibly scratched and is in need of renovation. -Windows don't have screens.  Would advise a higher floor, especially for women.  First floor window is easily accessible to        unwanted visitors!  The window also didn't lock properly.  I asked to change rooms but due to over capacity was told he    would ""give me a great room"" tomorrow. -My bed did not…",2
Our quiet room was at the rear of the hotel facing a small service road. There was a busy road at the front of the hotel. The outdoor swimming pool and lounging area was on the roof which was delightful. I think it was heated as it was a comfortable temperature. From here the views of the sea and town were extensive. ,4
"I visited rabat on official work and stayed there for 45 days, from december to january. during this period i stayed in Golden Tulip Farah Rabat hotel, To be honest this hotel is at very good location and the treatment which i got from hotel staff is too awesome, kind and good. Rooms where good, service was good excellent.   Receptionist handled my queries in a very professional way , Receptionists - Miss Laila and Miss Imane both were very good, and very professional, they are excellent. and apart from this two there was another guy mr hisham was also too good , alhamdulillah.   Coming to room service there was 1 girl named Nouilah she kept my room clean and tidy , the way she use to make my room was too awesome and if i give her rating then i may giver her 10 out of 10 rating…",5
"Good the opportunity to be upgraded to suit, nice one with good view on hassan area, somehow noisy during the day, nice staff and good service offered, secured place and close to city center, easy access",4
"Stayed here part of a pre arranged tour.   For Breakfast, everything was cold! ...no heat lamps either,  Th scrambled eggs are tasteless and very watered down.....we ordered tea, came lukewarm .....staff in the restaurant made no effort to be friendly or speak to us.....we always show our kindness and politeness, so don't know why .....i guess they don't like westerners ! ..... Hotel is very dated, and beds very worn out!  The only staff that were pleasant, were the desk.   ",1
"Even when the keycard to my door refused to open a number of times, the staff were willing to get me to another room and offer me the best calmness. The mini-fridge was empty and I called at 2am to have it filled....They did just that. Everything I wanted was delivered to me in real time. What better way to feel the gentleness of the Morocco people, a country I was to stay in for just a week. Amazing just.",4
"I stayed for four night primarily for business.  The hotel is convenient to the Medina and the old quarter of Rabat, and very close to the Sale airport.  When I checked in, I found a welcome gift of a heaping fruit basket and a plate of cookies.  However, the furniture was tired and dated, with dressers that were peeling paint and chairs with worn upholstery.  My rate included breakfast, which was a buffet that included hot and cold items, fruit, juices, and some Moroccan specialties too, including Moroccan tea.  However, the restaurant would get crowded very quickly and the wait staff would be overwhelmed.  Lots of groups stayed here, including domestic and international visitors and airline crews.  Wifi worked and was reasonably fast and free.  If you have business in the…",3
"I was here with my group from iran. The property is in the heart of all you desire. Just walk to enjoy what you must experience while you are here. The rooms are ok.if you consider about the view,you may chose river view. The thing I could not understand is the name Farah. The most important thing for me are the staffs whom the best one in my point of view was Ms Imane Hajjow who take care of group,very inteligent ,polite and cooperative. Thanks to hotel management for choosing her for reception.",5
Positive : great position & good shower.  Not so great: Double checked at reception at check in we were in a room with a double or queen bed - confirmed as yes. When we went to the room - completely untrue - two separate super singles. Went back to reception and was given anther room - asked if it would have a similar view and told yes. In reality - we got a queen bed and no view.   No bath towels - required two phone calls   to resolve.   The bed did not have a mattress protector at all. Sub standard and not hygienic  in any hotel.  At 11pm I couldn't be bothered to converse with reception again.  My partner stayed here three years ago and had none of these problems.,2
"My biggest bugbear is that so many hotels have poor lighting in the room. This was the exception, with good lighting and airconditioning that worked. The room was large, with 2 x 3/4 beds. Friends in an adjoining room had no air conditioning. They called maintenance 4 times, but no-one turned up to repair it. They also had no glasses or soap in their room, Our room was ok but we didn't have a bath plug. This hotel was the only one where the buffet dinner was hot. The breakfast buffet didn't have any salt and pepper, serviettes or ready-made mint tea. We didn't check out the pool.",4
This is the worst hotel I experienced. No curtains in the shower. Cockroach in the room .old coffee machine that got dirty steam nozzle. Poor breakfast buffet with no signs to describe the food. The tables are dirty because the staff are busy talking to each other. I used so many Golden Tulips but never ever use this one.,1
we came with a  big group for one night the hotel looks poor from the outside but inside it's much better and modern the swimming pool on the roof looking real good and there is a bar too very nice places to walk outside,4
I like the place is middle of city behind Hassan -the hotel have a good service but the furniture and design is very old -no free breakfast -have a valid free parking -free low level wifi-gym is very bad.,3
"I stayed one night here. It apparently has a 5 star rating but I really am not sure if it deserves that. 1) At check-in, we were asked to sit in the lobby for welcome drink. It never came. After about 20 minutes, we went to the reception and asked us to check in since we had to go out again for a meeting. 2) Rooms are distributed in an unusual way - some in one wing and the others in another wing. Reception guy did not tell us that the rooms allotted to me and my colleague were in different sections. It was only on arriving on the 1st floor, did we realize that my colleague would need to go back down and then to the other end via another elevator 3) There are NO TEA-COFFEE machines in the room. That is so very odd. I was told to call room service anytime I needed to have that.…",3
