"What an amazing hotel to stay in Staff well trained and so kind  Breakfast was really delicious and varied, the room was spacious and comfortable I even got the best service I would ever ask for, and I really appreciate the good food and the other different favors such as the Moroccan Hammam and the spa I highly recommend it",5
"I stayed here for 4 nights in September 2022 and enjoyed the stay.  The room was spacious and comfortable, breakfast was a delightful buffet with American, European, and Moroccan foods, and the restaurant staff were friendly.  The tram line is 1 block away, and you are walking distance to the art museum.  Visiting Hassan Tower was about a 20 minute walk, and 20 minutes more brought you to the entrance to the Medina.",5

"My experience here was horrible. Stayed in room 404 on October 1, 2022. It was so filthy, as were the hallways. It was prepaid through a private tour and it was late at night after a very long day or we would have walked out when we saw the room.  The carpets in our room and in the hallway were covered in nasty stains, the shower had loads of black mold on the walls and in the corners, the handle of the hairdryer was encased in dirt. My nightstand was a rickety dirty piece of glass. The room smelled so badly of mildew that we had to sleep with the balcony door open.   The breakfast was not much better. They had food that was supposed to be hot (scrambled eggs, meats, etc.) sitting on hot plates that were not working. I asked for scrambled eggs and the lady pointed me to the cold eggs in a pot. I told her they were cold, she said no they weren‚Äôt and I proceeded to put my hand directly on the ‚Äúhot‚Äù plate to show her it wasn‚Äôt working and she just shrugged. I did get her to make me an omelet as that was the only way I could get something fresh.   Stay away from this place. I cannot understand the positive reviews. Oh, and the lobby reeks of smoke.‚Ä¶",2
"We stayed here for 3 nights and our experience was mixed.   BEDROOM  Good : We had a suite that consisted of three rooms. It was spacious, clean and well stocked with amenities. Bad : There were no doors between the different areas and it would benefit from a door separating the bedroom from the rest. The bed was hard and lumpy so was very uncomfortable. The air conditioning did not work. There were large stains on the carpet.  BREAKFAST  Good : The quality of the breakfast was good. The waitresses were polite but only one was friendly.  Bad : Apart from asking us about tea/coffee we were not asked if we needed anything else. There was no juice available  and we had to ask for some every day - on two occasions it arrived after a long time but on the third it never arrived until the time we left. Often, there was no-one around to cook eggs or pancakes. It made us feel that we were imposing on them as we constantly had to ask for various things.  STAFF  Good : The staff were polite  Bad : As the air conditioner did not work and was affecting our sleep, we asked if they could provide us with a fan on several occasions. We only received it on our final night. No explanations or apologies were given for the delay. The staff need to be more helpful and friendly.  Overall, this hotel could be great. It just needs some updating and staff training.‚Ä¶",4
"Nice staff and food in restaurant is delicious, A/C (does not functional well) and pillows (musty) need attention.  Location, less than 1 km from the railroad station and within walking distance to medina and waterfront.",3

"The staff are amazing, friendly and warm. We really felt special and looked after. The lobby is accommodating and plenty place to lounge. Bedroom is clean and neat but tired in some areas‚Ä¶ room was missing some basics on arrival such as a kettle and coffee cups. All in all enjoyed the stay and would stay again.",4
Great Hotel to stay in for a few nights! The staff was wonderful ‚Ä¶ esp Salah.  Salah helped us with directions numerous times and even walked out with us to point us in the right direction.  We ate at the restaurant one night and the food was very good.  The hotel is walking distance to the train station.,5
was a great experience. would like to thank all stuff especially Mustapha who did a recognised effort to make our stay pleasant and fantastic.   Restaurant also is wonderful  and full of variety of international dishes.  Overall I give 5 stars for Le Diwan hotel and recommend it for all. ,5

"We spent one night  in this property. The location is very good being easy walking distance  to the casbah and  variety of restaurants, that aside everything else in the hotel was on the border of average to poor . The check in and out was efficient but not very welcoming , the baggage and parking Porter was not only very efficient and helpful but was consistently friendly.The room (601) was reasonably spacious but very old fashioned and slightly depressing it was moderately clean but nothing outstanding facilities in the room were minimal but connectivity was adequate. Sleep quality was acceptable. The bathroom had been partially renovated but retained old ceramics which were definitely in need of cleaning toiletries were adequate but towels were of the use to be white variety‚Ä¶",3
Very helpfull and friendly staff. Rwceptionist was very helpfull. Was running late and by the time i arrived i had a very limited time to eat out.  She took my id and said to go and eat and everything will be ready when i came back. No fuss very professional. Also offered me the option to exchange money also which was very convenient. Would highly reccomend for a helpfull service. ,5
"We stayed at this downtown hotel in her butt for two nights. While the rooms are adequate in size, with king-size beds and small balconies, the bathroom definitely needed to be deep cleaned. There was a lot of mold in the bathtub tile corners. We were a little surprised to find that there were no drinking glasses in the bathroom.  Also, while breakfast was excellent as far as choices, service was spotty and slow. We had to ask several times for coffee. The air conditioner works fine in the rooms, but the common areas are not cool, mostly because doors are left open to let warm air in in many instances.",3
"I traveled to Rabat in May and stayed at Hotel LeDiwan for a week.  My stay was so comfortable! Everything was absolutely perfect; the management and hotel staff made my stay exceptionally well.  I traveled solo for business and everyone at the hotel was welcoming and made me feel taken care of.   The hotel is centrally located to shopping, medina, museums, beach area, banks, coffee shops, covid-19 testing labs and more. I walked everywhere and only used the taxi if I needed to arrive somewhere quickly.   I had a little down time in between meetings and was able to take advantage of the AMAZING, I mean SUPER AMAZING spa services. The ladies (Najia and Asilaa) truly have gifted hands with the massage and hamman services. If you have never tried a hamman spa treatment, Hotel‚Ä¶",5
"We were in Rabat for business. We booked one junior suite (nice big room, only airco could work better) and one standard room.  We had a nice stay. The hotel has a nice location an parking was free. We feeld very welcom by the staff. Breakfast was included and very good, wide range of choices.",4
Since some months ago I‚Äôve been going to the restaurant ‚Äúbrasserie‚Äù with my friends every Tuesday. It is really a full pleasure and wonderful experience that anything that is on the menu comes so nice and delicious. The Chef comes to make suggestions and he surprise us with wonderful dishes. Noura and the staff are always very kind.,5
A very good place with good service  i loved the food and enjoyed the place really much as well as the design and waitresses in here it was really awesome and gorgeous and really nice from the restaurant to do everything for us around here thanks to mrs housin and nora we really appreciate everything they done for us‚ù§Ô∏èü•Ä,5

"I came yesterday to take lunch with my friends at the restaurant, was very good. Then we went to the SPA and take a ""hamam"" and was more than wonderful, Asma was so nice and very kind person. The hotel is very clean and they respect and follow all the covid prevent protocols. I just love it, defiantly i'll come back and totally recommended.",5
"In 2017 I decided to take my husband and two precious little boys age 2 years and 4 months to visit my home town, so I picked this hotel to stay in for couple days while visiting my own family, I arrive to the hotel a little after midnight and try to check in so we can all rest after a long day traveling across the world. The receptionist asked me for a marriage certificate to prove that this is my husband and these boys are mine or else we can‚Äôt check in to our room that we already paid for.  I found it uncalled for but I did show him my kids birth certificates and my green card as I don‚Äôt travel Carrying my marriage papers with me specially after so many years of being married.

"I have to admit there'd been a lot of arranging for this business stay, including hotel. I was warned before, to ask specifically for non smoking room on higher floor. And that safety in Rabat in general is not the highest. I was prepared, but still shocked. I arrived late because my flight was delayed and there was nobody at dusty reception. Then some guy appeared taking my luggage and asking for tips. Receptionist appeared, I asked him twice is room is non smoking, he ensured me it is and sent me with this ""luggage guy"" upstairs. Room was of course full of smoke smell and claimed as non smoking.

"As it was my first Moroccan breakfast, Chef Loubna patiently described the dishes. She introduced me to the entire staff, instantly making me feel at home. She even cooked a special dish for me. Chef Loubna, shukraan lakum!",5
I stayed here as part of a Gate 1 tour to Morocco. It was centrally located. Walking distance to the Museums and not far from the palace. It was clean and modern. Dinner was amazing there. It is walking distance to restaurants .,4
"The Le Duran has good sized rooms, comfortable beds, nice clean washrooms.  The breakfast buffet is very good In quality and quantity. Staff are helpful.  The location is excellent. There is a restaurant, spa and a bar.  What else a traveller really needs I am not sure. This is a wonderful place to stay in Rabat.  ",5
"A massage is a special treat for me when I travel to different countries. After three airports and 14 hours in air I arrived in Robat, Morocco and checked into the lovely LeDiwan hotel.  Noticing the spa was advertising massage I booked one hoping it would help me sleep. I would highly recommend a massage with Charifa.  Truly it was so relaxing I almost fell asleep then and there.  The soft Moroccan music played in concert with her hands moving in waves over my body.  Charifa has a talent for providing an experience that will be etched in your muscle memory. It was in mine.

"Clean, classy hotel ideally located in the best part of town. Close enough to the Medina, but far enough to be extremely safe anytime during the day or night.  Rooms were very clean and upscale. The best part however was the staff. Extremely hospitable and responsive, wanting to make sure that each individual guest had a personal experience of note. This included being greeted by name at check in. Highly unusual for most cookie cutter places these days. The front office manager Mr. Omar Moursli personally welcomed everyone in the group as did the chief concierge, Mr. Salah Malaki who even took us to the rooms himself to make sure they were to our satisfaction.   The first night when we walked into the restaurant, there was no one in sight. The entire bus load of people descended‚Ä¶",5
"Our breakfast at the Dewan were extra special because of the friendly funny service of Mohammed and Said( with mustache).  Actually every staff at the Dewan gave excellent service. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the breakfast buffet huge and full of regional specialties, the front desk staff and door staff always attentive and kind. Highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure travel.",5
"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights. Excellent location, good sized and well  appointed rooms.   The BIG plus is the staff: front desk, bartending, porters, servers in the restaurants.   In particular, we had a  server in the main dining room on the night of our arrival named HANANE who was so friendly, informative and well trained.  It was our first meal in Morrocco and she helped to make it memorable....She helped us choose our first Moroccan dishes and Moroccan wine. Great ambassador for the hotel!",5
"Charifa at the hammam spa was amazing. She provided a great massage and great hammam experience. I highly recommend seeing her and trying the spa if you are in the area.  Spa and Charifa get 5 stars. The hotel staff is really nice. I wouldn‚Äôt give the hotel a 5 star rating because it is not very clean.   Loved the breakfast, they serve freshly squeezed orange juice:)",5
"If you happen to be in Morocco and you are looking for a great spa experience make sure you book it at the Li Diwan.  My masseuse, Charifa,  was amazing.  I travel a lot and have gotten many massages but this one was really good.  I have a couple of days left here and I am sure I will be back again before I go.  ",5
"I had the 120 minute Hammam and massage treatment.  It was my first Hammam and Najia was terrific.  It was cleansing, exfoliating and a massage in one.  After the massage by Charifa put the icing on the cake.  Highly recommended after a long day of traveling!",5
"I would like to leave a comment about the spa specialist Loubna! She is AMAZING! I‚Äôve been to full body massage and hammam, and it was the best 2 hours this year! First of all I would like to say that the spa is very clean and comfortable. Loubna welcome you very kindly, and make the atmosphere very relaxing. I want to say that I received a real full body massage from head to tip fingers! And after in hammam a full body wash, scrub and lotion. After all, she made me tea, and it was fantastic. I will highly recommend this spa and Loubna!",5
We stayed here at the start of a Gate 1 tour. The room was fine and the opening dinner in the hotel's restaurant was quite good. The staff was really friendly and helpful in responding quickly to several requests.,4
"This hotel provides extremely good service as well as very clean, quiet rooms. The restaurant  ‚ÄúLa Brasserie‚Äùs food is excellent . The servers Houcine, Hanane and Sanae were very professional and went out of their way to make us feel welcome, detailing their traditional dishes. The Food & Beverage Director was very helpful as well. Le Diwan is located in a very nice area where you can walk at your leisure. We hope to come back here and stay for a longer time.",5
"We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of a Gate1 tour. The front desk staff, particularly Hamza, were fantastic, patiently taking care of our every request. Loubna and Charles, members of the spa staff, gave wonderful massages. Breakfast is also very good. Our room feels a bit tired, but the excellent service makes up for that.",5
We stayed 2 nights on the first leg of our trip and it was very nice. The service was exceptional. My wife and I also treated ourselves to a hammam in the spa and Charifa and Loubna were excellent!  It was our first hammam and they made it a great experience!  I highly recommend doing this. It was great! ,5
"This hotel is in a great location and initially shows promise. However, our 2 night stay there was very disappointing and very challenging to the senses. It allows smoking in the lobby, first sign of an inferior hotel. It is apparently built near a sewage sight as it reeked of sewage at night. To make matters worse, they have machines on each floor that are used to negate the bad smell by dispensing an overpowering perfume smell that permeates the hallways. Amazingly, this smell is even worse than the sewage smell. Finally, and not least, we were kept awake very late one night by some very loud guests in the room above us and we had to complain several times to the front desk before anything was done.

"PROS: - Very friendly service from the car park to front desk for check-in/out - Moden design, simple but functional in all aspects  - Great breakfast buffet (not too big but with all different choices), again great service team - Very central located for a walk to old town CONS: - no sport possibilities  - some furnishings and equipments in bathroom should be replaced  ",4
I come to Rabat for work every 2-3 months and always stay at Le Diwan. I recommend the hotel. The personnel is really nice and one feels at home. This time I tried the spa and really enjoyed the signature massage and the hammam-scrub. Great service from Najia and Dougna.,5

It's conveniently close to the downtown, The staff are friendly and helpful, Ismail the front office young man was just great and he helped us with everything we needed, the rooms were super comfortable, and everything was clean and simple. I can't recommend them enough!",5
"Pros: Staff are great, rooms are comfortable, spa is reasoanly priced & the breakfast/dinner is nice!  Cons: Location has little around it, wifi is terrible and I could not even do e-mail, no gym.  Unsure what else to stay but it is an average to good hotel at best.",3
"I have stayed at Diwan‚Äôs for two nights. Clean, central, excellent service. Very good Brasserie, I had a succulent tajine  well accompanied by a decent local red wine. I particularly recommend the spa of the hotel, where I used the massage services twice. Najia is an outstanding physiotherapist who mixes the right kind of strength and relaxation; this was the best by far of my spa experiences in the last couple of years.",5
Recomendation: a massage session or two.  Najia brought me back to relax and peacefulness after a one hour of treatment. All people at reception focused on help you to find solutions to your problems..,4
"The room was beautiful and I had a small but lovely balcony with a great view. The hotel didn't have a pool or a gym but the staff was friendly and I liked the decor of the lobby. Breakfast was included and it was typical cereal, bread, fruit but there were Moroccan pancakes that I got to try for the first time. They were OK.   The hotel was in a convenient location. I was able to walk to a pharmacy since I caught a head cold on the plane ride and there was a store nearby where we could buy water and snacks. ",4
I took a Gate1 tour in Morocco and we were supposed to stay in Le Dewan for two nights. We got a 5th Fl room with a good view(504). The beds were nice with clean sheets and soft comforters. But the bathroom is really old. It needs to be renovated. The drifting water flows through the ring of the sink all the way to the floor which became slippery.  What made me really upset was the second morning episode on 11/14/2019. I didn‚Äôt have a good sleep because of the long journey from the New York-Casablanca flight and the Casablanca-Rabat taxi drive. I forgot that I was supposed to go to the mezzanine breakfast room.

We did eat in their dinner restaurant and the meal was fine.   We were in Morocco for two weeks and I never got sick but we ate in the hotels or highly recommended restaurants.  Service was good.",4
The room was dirty with stains on the carpets and coffee stains on the walls.when I took a shower the bathroom filled with water and I almost slipped. This was bad experience and I would recommend to stay away and book another hotel.,1
"I was on a Gate 1 tour and this was the first accommodation upon arrival in Rabat. For 1 night it as perfectly fine, the room was small but well kept.  Furnishings were outdated and could use some upgrading. The bed was very comfortable. Dinner and breakfast were great, and all staff were very nice. There are many ATMs nearby, but if you walk out the hotel front door, turn left, the 2nd ATM slightly up the street is the one that offers English option. Just put your card in first to get it started.",4

The very modern city train system travels right across the street from the hotel. It is a fairly modern-looking hotel. While the weather in Rabat is much cooler than most of the country, A/C is still needed. The lobby and mezzanine did not have A/C and it was slightly stuffy in those areas. The room is small, but generally nice and clean. There was a slight musty odor when entering the room, but the odor dissipated after a short period of time.

Hotel Staffs are helpful with all our Group Luggage as our Tour Guide has mentioned to identified our luggage so that they can be put inside the Tour Bus with the correct Passengers' Lugguage - No One are to be left behind without their luggage, this systems ensured that everyone have it before we left for a different city - approx. 8 hours drive to Fez.

The day I was checking out with my group really left a bitter taste in my mouth on this place. I had charged a few things to my room and the night before checkout I settled up so there wasn‚Äôt any issues in the AM. Well got pulled aside by the tour guide and the front desk had zero record of me settling up. Thankfully I had the receipt and credit card receipts in my purse. They were like oops our bad. I felt like a scum bag for a minute with being pulled aside. ,3

This hotel is a short walk from the contemporary art museum, archaeology museum (recommended), and the local medina (an average medina).  The rooms and baths are comfortable, quiet; breakfast buffet was average.  A relatively dull neighborhood, with few shops or restaurants, but was full of ATMs and banks.  The elevators were slow and choppy; most guests used to stairs to get to the rooms, which in this hotel are 3-6 floors above the lobby.",3

I stayed for a week and the amazing staff made me feel like at home.  It‚Äôs located right in the middle of everything so all the popular spots are within a few minutes of drive/walk.  I had some of the best food at the Brasserie le diwan.  Keep it up guys üëçüèª  ,5

It made being in the room feel unclean. When we asked about changing to another room, were told that it‚Äôs like that in every room. We also just didn't find the room was cleaned very well, per photos - walls, doors and other surfaces had marks that I was able to remove with a cloth so just shows they weren't cleaned well. There was a loud rattling every night through the wall ‚Äì not sure the cause of the sound.

"As far as hotels go, Hotel Le Diwan is a good choice for the money. It certainly isn't the most luxurious hotel in Rabat, but the rooms are a decent size and comfortable, staff is friendly, and the food quite good. The biggest bonus is the hotel's proximity to everything. You can walk to most points of interest without an issue.   Pros: Breakfast - very good WiFi - free, fast, reliable Location - roam the sights easily Air Conditioning - quiet and works well Curtains - total darkness if desired  Cons: Carpet in my room was dirty - appeared somewhat consistent throughout the common area, too Gym - None   ",4
We got a suite and it was very nice and super clean. Very comfortable bed. Right on a busy roundabout but if the windows are closed the sound is muffled. There was a nice breeze when the windows are open. Easy to walk to many sights and very safe. What makes this hotel stand out is the staff. We were particularly WOWED by Omar the desk manager and Younes Malki who went way above and beyond the expected and personally made sure that my wife got to visit the site of the hospital where she was born. It's being turned into a hotel now but Younes drove our party of four there and walked with us to make sure we were safe. He was so gracious and sympathetic when my wife became a little emotional. The breakfast staff was very attentive and the porters were friendly and accommodating. I‚Ä¶,5

"Our tour of Morocco began in Rabat, so we were only here for one night. The staff was friendly, and was quite patient with us crazy folks from Philadelphia. :) Two of my travel companions and I had a light lunch in the restaurant before gathering with the rest of our group. The food was tasty and filling, and the wait staff was very friendly. None of us speaks French, which is common here, but the staff knew enough English for us to get along fine. The room was small, but not claustrophobically so. There were two twin beds pushed together, making it look like one queen bed, but they were made up separately, so my roommate and I each had our own bed. Slippers and robes were provided, which was a nice touch. There was a bit of a problem flushing the toilet, at times, if others‚Ä¶",4
"Conveniently located, the hotel is in a busy area and there is a lot of noise going on outside.  Like many hotels in Morocco, they use a heavy scent/perfume in the public areas, but it was not too bad in the guest rooms. There was, however, a faint moldy smell in the rooms. The front desk staff was very nice.  We had a superb dinner in the restaurant and breakfast was also good.  However, the breakfast crew was less attentive and the service was inconsistent.  Sometimes they brought coffee, sometimes you had to fend for yourself.  Sometimes they were there to be of assistance, other times you had to get up and hunt someone down.",4
"as a regular visitor to rabat on business this is one of the places I prefer to stay, very central and practical, the hotel is clean and friendly staff, great buffet breakfast and very good value for money.",5
"The McGallery Diwan Hotel in Rabat is a comfortable place to stay. The room was spacious and nicely furnished and the complimentary water and wifi were appreciated. The staff were helpful, friendly and carried out their duties effectively. The breakfast was varied and delicious with an egg station. All in all, a nice place to stay which is well-located only short walks to the main train station (12 minutes) and souqs (20 minutes).",5
"Good hotel, but one that can be improved. Well located. The staff is nice, except maybe one person in the restaurant. The regular staff needs to be more welcoming and smiling... The conference rooms are OK.",3
"We had a delicious meal in the restaurant for a good price. A convenient place to dine if you have just arrived jet lagged and couldnt be bothered searching for food on your first night. The rooms are comfortable and we slept well. Hot water are wifi is reliable, there is a room safe. Location is quite central and staff are excellent. The buffet breakfast was comprehensive but more low sugar cereal would enhance the  experience.",4
"We were on an escorted tour with Gate 1 Travel for 13 days throughout Morocco.  We stayed here our first two nights.  Very nice, comfortable, great food, service.  The only reason I gave this 4 of 5 stars is that the security device at the front door deactivates the room keys.  They know this is an issue, but failed to share that with us.  So, many in our group found out the hard way once we got back to our rooms after being out, necessitating a trip back to the desk.  Minor issue, more of a slight annoyance.  Would have been nice to know ahead of time.",4
"With no point of comparison to other Moroccan hotels, Le Diwan is fairly upscale. Our room is comfortable, as are the beds. Though the room is nicely decorated with warm wood throughout, it is in need of some minor renovation - carpeting is stained, the bathroom sink is chipped, etc.  The buffet breakfast is good with plenty of selections, including an omelette chef. The front desk is helpful with suggestions and directions. Several restaurants and a supermarket are within very easy walking distance. The Medina and souk (market/shopping) are an easy 20 minute walk from the hotel.  ",4
"Enjoyed staying at this hotel for two nights, just after arriving in Morocco from the U.S.  The hotel is very well maintained, very clean with very friendly and attentive staff.  Enjoyed a ""welcome dinner"" and drinks in the bar as well.",5
"January 31 and February 1, 2019 - As part of a 34 person tour group, we stayed for two nights at the Hotel Le Diwan.  The hotel has an excellent location, the staff are friendly and efficient, and the rooms are comfortable.  Our beds slept well, the bathroom was clean and the towels were good.  As in most European and other foreign country hotels, they do not provide a face cloth in the bathroom.  So, we always bring our own.  Our room had a television, balcony (although view was not too good), and a hot pot/coffee maker, and sufficient flat space for laying out our clothes, etc.  Unfortunately, the breakfast does not have a very good cereal selection.  But, you can get eggs to order like over easy or an omelette.  And, there is fruit and plenty of bread selections.  I would‚Ä¶",4
"Hotel location is good,it is down town. Rooms are wide clean and comfort ,restaurant Brasserie is super nice marrocan and international food,really tasty.Wifi is good,Tv channels are not nice ,staff are friendly",4
"I choose this place because of the location, and because they belong to the familiar hotel chain ‚Äì so I could anticipate the level of service. It started very well, they have sent me message few days before my arrival asking about my needs ‚Äì which was promising. But after I sent them my requests ‚Äì I had to wait almost 24 hours for a respond. They promised to fulfil all my request, but when I came to the hotel ‚Äì just half of it was done. During the day I have ordered more water ‚Äì it has never arrived. Infrastructurally they are good, some refreshment is needed, but everything was clean. Location was extremely good ‚Äì everything was in walking distance. Breakfast was good too ‚Äì in line with chain standards, with some local products. To conclude, they have a great potential, but‚Ä¶",4
"Good value. Nice and friendly staff,excellent d√©cor. Thank you for a wonderful stay at the hotel .I was upgraded.the decor was top of the Line,the staffs were ever smiling and the rooms were clean. The location IS the best you can think of.it IS a great value for money. ",5
"Since I had such a good meal at the hotel in 2017, I decided to stay again this year. I found the hotel. Although it is not near any place walking, it is worth it for their great restaurant.  Service by the staff is still very helpful",5
"Nice staff,clean room,very comfortable bed.Especially liked the plush terry robe after showering!Also ate several meals in the restaurant which were excellent.Delicious Harira(a typical Moroccan soup.)",4
"The location of this hotel is great withing walking distance ti many sights and restaurants. Nice staff ,good service,confort sleep. The breakfast was good with a lot of choices. Thank you very much .i will turn back again. Hihly recimmended.",5
"Where to start?  The good:  -room was clean - everything was stocked  - nice little Juliet balcony - quite pretty  The bad: - dingy towels and robes, not white and overly worn out. Gross. - other than the old hairdryer there is ONE outlet in my room. Substandard. There‚Äôs not even one by the bed! Only one room key, key maker broken (so when you leave the AC is off and you return to a muggy room) - AC is not good, had to leave window open to balcony for air which is noisy - No hotel store so if you forget something you‚Äôre out of luck   If I was paying less, I‚Äôd be more tolerant, but at the price I expect better than this. It‚Äôs okay but lackluster. ",2
"This was a clean, updated hotel with very polite staff. I liked the spacious lobby with beautiful stonework. Room was clean and the bidet was a nice tough. It appears every room has their own balcony. ",4
"Very decent hotel, good location as well. If you walk straight from the main entrance in 5 min  you will get to the Royal Palace on the left and Art museum on the right. If you turn right after museum and follow the main street in about 15 min you will get to the endless city market. If you will walk from the hotel in opposite direction in about 15-20 min you will get to Hassan Tower.   ",4
"Our room smelled of mildew. One of our party needed to relocate for this reason. Elevators are quite small and do not always stop evenly with the floor. We had problems with the lighting system - there is a card, a button and the switches. You must use all three. This was never explained. I complained at the the desk and no one responded. Bed was very comfortable. But bath/shower required a high step to enter and exit and could be difficult for persons with hip or knee problems.",3
"We stayed here 1 night on our recent Gate 1 Tour of Morocco. Le Diwan is a decent tourist/business class hotel in the middle of the Rabat Medina.  Its an easy walk to many landmarks although we did not venture out of the hotel.  Rooms were on the smaller side, as ours only had a double bed. Bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows and blankets.TV was big and remote was easy to use.  There were a few English language channels to choose from. Bathroom was clean and the shower was European tub.shower combo which something to be desired.  We had dinner in the hotel and it was buffet style and good, but not very Moroccan.  Breakfast in the AM was good. The hotel bar was quiet and reasonably priced with local wines about $7 a glass.  Not a bad crash spot for our first night in‚Ä¶",4
But the breakfast was the best and the staff tried hard.   Smoking in the bar was overwhelming.  Door man helped us with the petite cabs.  Overall an average hotel.  The elevator should have been replaced a decade ago.,3
"a wonderful experience, very well centered h√¥tel, easy access to most touristic attractions. Very professional and friendly staff from the doorman up, and the food is just out of this world. All in all a wonderful experience in hospitality. Keep up the good work.",5
"This was the first time i came here And it was a great experience , the hole crew Were welcoming and all smiling with clients , the breakfast was delicious with a lot of options right at the Time, I will absolutely Go There For An other Visit , Recommend The place.",5
