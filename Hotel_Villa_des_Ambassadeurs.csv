"This hotel is unique in its traditional decor and well worth a visit. The family are so accommodating and friendly, the breakfast waiter so nice, definitely will be back. The bedroom was v big, balcony looking out into a lovely garden with outdoor pool.",5
"Having travelled several times to Morocco and stayed in big standard business hotels I was delighted to arrive at this lovely hotel. I found the building very beautiful and I kept taking photos of the Moroccan features. The staff were very helpful and accommodating, arranging taxis for us to be taken around. Hospitality was superb. I really felt like I visited Morocco on this trip. I would love to visit again. Thank you!",5
"We highly recommend this villa for leisurely stay or for event and wedding rentals! We  brought 50 international guests and 50 Moroccan nationals to Villa des Ambassadors for our wedding last Saturday. Every guest complimented the extraordinary beauty and elaborate detail of the venue, and enjoyed the perfectly maintained quiet garden area as well. The villa owners were wonderful to work with and gave my guests the most beautiful setting for my wedding. The grounds workers and cleaners were patient with us and were exceptional in their service. They even returned a guitar to us we had accidentally left behind and were trustworthy and helpful. I recommend everyone spend time in this enchanting villa as I will always remember my experience here, as will my guests from around the world. Thank you for everything! Absolutely stunning venue and excellent service!  Bree and Badr…",5
We stayed with 6 people and a baby in Villa des ambassadors in 3 rooms. The Villa is the perfect place to spend quality time with family or in a couple. The staff is incredibly nice and helpful. The food is absolutely fantastic and the place clean and authentic. The garden is wonderful and the pool is ideal to drink a nice orange juice and relax. The facilities in the room are very good and the bed is hard but comfortable. A special thanks to Abdullah the manager who helped us arrange all transports (with a baby) and informed us by phone we had forgotten a jacket in our room.  We would recommend this place to anyone interested in enjoying a quiet time in Rabat while being close to restaurants and the center.,5
"The villa is located about four miles south of Rabat centre on the broad, impressive Avenue Mohammed VI, but set back from the noisy traffic on its own service road. The traditional Moroccan décor - impressive doors, pillars, marble floors, carpets and heavy furnishings - is gloomy in April (lots of steps, so beware!) but must be delightfully welcoming in high summer.  There are just six rooms, three downstairs and three up. Ours was quite spacious, with a comfortable double bed, perfectly adequate ensuite and a charming balcony with lemon blossom and lemons within touching distance. The restaurant has a limited menu, but the food is delicious. A word of advice, though; alcohol is very expensive (eg. MAD180 for a half-bottle of white wine). The staff are friendly, helpful and welcoming. The garden is lovely, with a decent-sized pool and adjoining children's pool. The nearby storks are a constant source of interest as they fly to and from their incredible nests. The villa is quite far from central Rabat; There is a bus-stop opposite, but we used the blue 'petits taxis' which are so convenient and cheap - about MAD 30 (£2.50) to the centre - and you get to experience the thrill of Moroccan driving! One negative, which disappointed my wife in particular; The villa's haman or Turkish bath is currently closed for renovation.…",5
"My review will only include the lobby and the service. Other reviewers who stayed there will definitely provide better informations on the rooms I've been there to work with one of our business partners. It is very well located but without a car, it is hard to visit the city. The neighborhood is very nice and a walk around the place is a must.  The entrance is somptuous; bold Moroccan architecture. The main door itself is a piece of art. There is a swimming pool in the garden where having breakfast on a sunny day is a nice experience The staff is friendly, helpful, very polite, smiling and better than in regular hotels, but there is a need of hiring more HR because I had the impression that the two peope I saw had many different jobs However, the decoration is ""too much"" and the lobby (in particular the Moroccan salon) looks very dark. Villa des Ambassdors is good for a business trip or a retreat. If you'd like to walk around, meet locals, visit the city, do tourism and stay for more than just a couple of nights, I'd recommend staying in other places…",4
"This hotel is located in a nice neighbourhood, it was the residence of an ambassador before!  6 rooms, traditional style, with nice garden with pool.  Small menu, but very good, and very friendly staff.  I will be back when I come to Rabat!",5
I stayed here for 3 nights while on business in Rabat. The villa is beautifully authentic and it has a nice garden and pool where you can relax after a busy day. It is also one of the best places to eat in Rabat. The staff are very pleasant and helpful and they make you feel at home. There are only 6 rooms so it is not impersonal or noisy and busy like a hotel. The storks and their chicks nesting in the trees by the garden were very interesting to watch.,4
"i loved this place. it's calm, traditional and the staff is very cool. i suggest this place for all the tourists that want a taste of the traditional moroccan architecture. it has a swimming pool if you want to swim",5
"This was my first stay in Morocco (or anywhere in North Africa). I was here for work at the University. This is an EXCELLENT hotel. The standard of accommodation is easily akin to a good 4 star european hotel. The bed very comfortable. The sheets high quality cotton. The downstairs is like something out of the Ottoman Empire and I am not sure I have ever seen such a blinged up dining room. The staff could not be more kind, friendly and helpful. It feels more like staying in someone's house and is more akin to a European Villa than a hotel. Nabil and the gentleman who staffed the reception in the evening were exceptionally good at making sure that all my various needs were met. The only word of caution I would sound is that the hotel is nearly 8K out of town and not on the tram route. It costs between 30 and 50 MAD to get in and out and as long as you have decent French you can persuade a blue taxi. It was certainly a wonderful place to come back to after three long working days.…",5
The staff of the hotel was very welcoming right from the start. The hotel is calm and beautiful with a nice moroccan style and modern facilities. The room was comfortable and large. The bed is perfect. I will come back.,5
"This is a lovely hotel situated in the diplomatic sector. It has traditional Moroccan decor but also has a swimming pool. Don't expect a plastic hotel, this hotel has character. The only downside is that it is difficult to find. But once found it is worth it. It has great staff who are very helpful. Definitely worth using again especially if you don't need to be in the city. ",4
Although a little hard to find because it is actually a residence and hotel it was well worth the search up and down the street it is beautiful inside and we were the only guests but we had a lovely evening meal served to us  and bedroom was perfect .,5
"My mother and I had a wonderful time at the Villa des Ambassadors.The place is exceptional and the staff is really, really helpful and professional: you feel at home with good friends. I highly recommend the Spa: world class with a reasonable price.  Thanks everyone, we now I have an address in Rabat! Mounah",5
"This Hotel (Villa) is located outside the city but is worth to try it. Located in a beautiful area this hotel is absolute a must to see/experience. Authentic and quite. Very helpfull staff. All were very kind. Good food, especially the traditional kitchen. A place to come back with family.",4
"I stayed at the Hotel Villa de Ambassadors for 4 nights in September 2015. The hotel GORGEOUS- every detail is pure luxury. (afterwards I went on a 7 day tour of Morocco and this was still THE nicest hotel I stayed in) Food was great.  Pool was wonderful, cold, great places to sit and relax outside.  But the #1 thing was the above and beyond service that I received from the hotel owners and management.   I came to Morocco for a wedding. I had a new iPhone 6. I dropped the iPhone 6 in the toilet.  I went to ask for a paperclip to remove the SIM from my phone. When the manager (Abdullah) heard what happened, he offered to help me get another iPhone to use for my stay. I ended up being driven to the Medina by Mourad (works at the hotel) in his private car, and escorted to a phone…",5
"Our stay here was impeccable.  It is easy to find, there is safe parking on the street as well as private parking.  It is like a jewel inside.  One of the staff members, Abdullah, was invaluable.  He assisted us with telephone calls and directions and was absolutely lovely.  The rooms were comfortable, beautifully decorated and the bathrooms were clean and modern! Breakfast was fresh and delicious and included eggs in addition to breads, freshly squeezed orange juice, and coffee or tea.  You could also eat have lunch or dinner there and the couscous was excellent.  It is 5 minutes from the Dar es Salam Golf course, the Wifaq (tennis club) and about 10 minutes from the Dar es Salam Riding club.  I am very grateful for such a wonderful experience and we would definitely stay here…",5
"The room that we got is extremely small and there is no fridge in the room. The room equipment is very poor for the price,The breakfast is nice. I think this nice hotel can improve the rooms. The staff is extremely friendly",4
It wose the Best place that ı satay befor everything wose perfeckt the rooms the staff cleaning food fantastick.I will stay again in my naxt trip.I can recomment all my friend this hotel managment wery profetional,5
"As for a couple of other reviewers, I was notified that I couldn't have my room on the day of my arrival as boiler had broken with a flood. Repairs required cutting of electricity and water so it would have been an uncomfortable stay. However, unlike the other reviewers I did not doubt the truth of this. The hotel had found an alternative room in a different hotel. While this was frustrating and disappointing I feel the hotel did all they could to make amends including offering to pay for my alternative accommodation. As soon as the problem was fixed I was notified and came back to the hotel, which is a truly wonderful and magical place. Calm, inspiring, beautiful decor. The manager did their best to make amends and I had a welcome bowl of fruit and sincere apologies. Wifi…",5
"We are supposed to stay here for 6 nights, had a pick up at the airport organised, had called ahead to make sure that our arriving a day early wouldn't upset any planning and so arrived in Rabat, looking forward to 'dream' experience. Opp, the nightmare started with the taxi driver claiming that he didn't know where the hotel was, and then telling us that the Villa des Ambassadors had booked us into another hotel of the same price. My husband insisted on going to the Villa, where eventually someone answered, and said, sorry the hotel is closed because of power and water problems. We have to have a doubt as there were people sitting around the pool eating, and we couldn't understand why the need to lie, if there really was a technical problem, but the first hand experience with…",1
"We spent two nights at the Villa des Ambassadors. Chemssa the owner is so genuine and friendly, she makes you feel like part of the family. After a long day of sightseeing, we would come back and lounge by the pool. The grounds are very nicely landscaped, and the pool was wonderful. We enjoyed the villa so much, we even decided to have dinner here every night. The food was excellent, and the breakfasts were the best we had in Morocco. We booked the suite, and our son had his own room with a balcony facing the pool and another one facing the back. He invited Chemssa's cat, Mimu into his room, and she slept with him all night. If only we could have stayed longer. This hotel really is a little bit of heaven!",5
"This is exactly the place that I was looking for in Rabat. This is such a beautiful villa with a large pretty garden and a nice pool. The staff was very friendly, helpful and discret. We did not feel like in a hotel, just like visiting relatives. We had delicious Moroccan food, we could even order our own menu. The breakfast was amazing, served even late in the morning. Very relaxing stay. We will get back there for sure!",5
"Went to that villa twice already, everytime I go I discover new features, I really enjoy the moroccan design, the food that was delicious and 100/ moroccan, and the morocan culture that is presented in that place. Rooms are 100/ clean, stuff is very friendly , and prices are reasonable, the reception was charming and make you think that you are dreaming , brief every single thing in that villa was what I expect from every single break I need in my life, I spent 10 days in my first trip, and my second trip was two weeks , so I stayed in the same place.  Hope I will get back again soon.",5
