"My second stay at the Marriott Rabat and I have to say that EVERYONE breathes hospitality in this property.  Incredible staff from the moment you step a foot till the moment of check out. Nabil, the rooms director alongside with Khadija, the front office manager, and Abdelhaq, the night manager, and the F&B director, mostapha,  are all hands on and keep a close eye on their guests to make sure that the stay is nothing but EXCELLENT.  As a titanium member that spends around 90 nights a year in Marriott brands, I have to say that these guys strive to make sure that your stay is as satisfying as a Ritz Carlton or St Regis. A huge thank you to the Marriott agdal staff( Amira, Ismael, Malak, Med Amine) for their genuine service. Keep up the Excellent work, you are all amazing at what you do ü´∂üèºü´∂üèº‚Ä¶",5
"The new Marriott in downtown Rabat is a delight. Opened for only 3 months or so, it‚Äôs an amazingly comfortable oasis in the middle of the city.  The hotel amenities and attention to detail are exactly what one would expect from a Marriott five star. From the breakfast to the gym/spa, all 5 star quality and service.  A special shout out to Mr. Amin from Meknes. Mr. Amin exemplified the Marriot five star standard, going out of his way to give us extremely good recommendations for our short stay in Rabat. We just wish we had had more time to enjoy the lobby, which is so inviting; we could easily have spent an afternoon ensconced reading and writing.  Really, a gem of a five star.",5
Great 3 day visit at the Marriott.  Looks very impressive on the inside.  Great selection of restaurants.  With a great breakfast.  Champions bar was a let down as it was so Smokey in there.  Spacious rooms with good amenities.  Just need to sort out the pick up and drop off area.  Was always crazy in the mornings and evenings.  Not very well thought out in its design.,5
"It was a quick business trip but very nice hotel. Will explore more next time. Food was good. One comment, could have been warmer when it got to my room.  Rooms are spacious,  very clean and the staff obviously well trained. 5 stars overall. I'll be back.",5
"The service at this hotel was unbelievably good, as was its cleanliness, wellness facilities, pool and multiple restaurants.  We were there for a conference and were very well supported by remarkable staff. Special recognition to Front Office manager Khadjia Nadzi - both charming and very capable.",5
"Our family of 3 adults and one teen had the pleasure of spending a night at Rabat Marriott on our arrival in Morocco for a 10-day tour - this hotel stay made for a terrific start to the trip!  The hotel is brand new, having opened only a few months ago.  That said, it is the incredible service throughout that really shines, in particular the warm welcome we received from Nabil.  We also used the spa for a traditional hamam, which ended up being the best one of our entire trip.  Our only regret is that we were only there for one night!",5
"I had an excellent experience at the Mariott in Rabat. The staff were very professional and accommodating. Nabil, the director helped me book my last minute reservation, and had the pleasure of meeting him in person as well. He went above and beyond to accommodate me and made sure I had an enjoyable stay. The hotel is ideally located in the center of Rabat and within walking distance to shops and restaurants. The outdoor pool, the rooms and the spa are all breathtaking. The hotel is fairly new and I was astonished at the very small details throughout the property. I highly recommend this place. I will most definitely stay here again next time I come back to Morocco.",5
"We have been to Morocco several times, me and my wife and to be honest this is the first time we felt the Moroccan hospitality deeper; the hotel is stunning with all its facilities and services, the breakfast was nice, the swimming pool also was beautiful with the restaurant ikatza we really loved the food there. We would like to thank and appreciate the lady from the reception Ms Samia took really good care of us, she is an incredible host full of energy and kindness, she gave us a list of places to visit in Rabat and also where to eat nice Moroccan dishes that we really loved, whenever we leave the hotel for a visit or when we comeback she is there to greet us and makes us feel home. Thank you so much for your hospitality and we are telling our friends and family about your hotel and specially your people. We are coming back.‚Ä¶",5
"Wow! Gorgeous hotel but the staff make this an outstanding hotel. Excellent service! The front desk staff are fantastic.  The Spa is a must! Chaimae at reception was extremely helpful, and Sophia is an OUTSTANDING massage therapist. Try the hammam experience!",5
Stayed for one night in this luxurious hotel. The service was excellent !!  Spacious trendy room. Elegant restaurant and  relaxing pool. Executive lounge with great selection. Great location as well.  Thanks to the great hotel staff. Will come back again!,5
"A great hotel in a high-end district of Rabat, opened in summer 2022 (around 3 months ago at the time of this review).   The staff here are absolutely outstanding. From the reception, bars, restaurants, M club, spa - everyone blew us away with their warm smiles and attention to detail. Staff frequently remembered and used our names, which is a touch usually reserved for higher end brands than Marriott.   Marriott Platinum benefits were honoured including an upgrade from a basic room to a beautiful full sized suite with 1.5 bathrooms and a huge L shape leather sofa. Access to the M Club was provided and we were attended to beautifully by the lovely lady that runs it. Complimentary alcoholic beverages are served between 18:30-19:30 and hot snacks are also available.   Breakfast‚Ä¶",5
"I had the fortune of staying here during a long stay, and I had an amazing experience.  The hotel and the accommodations are excellent, given that the hotel is fairly new and just opened a few months ago.  While you can find similar or maybe even better accommodations in Rabat, the thing that sets the Marriott apart is the quality of the service.   Every single member of the staff will treat you like you are the most important guest in the hotel, and they will make you feel like royalty.   The breakfast buffet is one of the best buffets I have seen, with a great variety of food, and very friendly staff.  Hats off and kudos to Reda, one of the waiters there, who always greets you with a smile, is very attentive,  and makes the best cappuccinos! He really goes above and beyond to‚Ä¶",5
"Impeccable welcome with the assistance of the magnificent staff especially thanks to the precious contribution of the manager Kadija ( very efficient and very kind, ready to solve every problems). The rooms are perfect and equipped with all possible comforts. I had also the opportunity to training in their gym equipped with super-technological equipment, and finally a truly extraordinary SPA path. I absolutely recommend the Marriott Hotel if you are going to visit the city of Rabat.",5
"We recently stayed here on a quick trip to Morocco.  The hotel was nice.  We had a king bed that was large and comfortable.  We were upgraded to a suite room which was roomy.  The only concern here was there no safety door lock I could find.  I am used to having the second lock from the inside to lock the door.  This actually keep me up a little bit as the doors on the rooms close hard and it sounds like someone was knocking on your door.  The peace of mind with the additional lock would have helped, but once I got used to the noise, I slept great.  The shower was large and water pressure was good.  The towels were large and seemed fairly new. The pool area was large, and we were able to use it briefly after our day of touring Rabat, the pool was refreshing.  We also had dinner‚Ä¶",5
Very warm welcome at Reception. All the Staff very friendly and helpful. Ms Chaima at Spa and Ms Samia at Front Office were excellent. Rooms are new neat clean fresh and spacious we recommend this Hotel.,5
"I cannot fault this hotel. The staff are always willing to help and nothing it too much to ask. The hotel is clean, modern and comfortable. The breakfast is fantastic offering a wide range of food options. Conveniently located ATM onsite with a number of restaurant options at the hotel and close by. Tram stop is 100m from the hotel door and a shopping centre to the rear.",5
"We were one week in this amazing Hotel,  which is in a good location next  to the new Arribat Center. Everything was well organized, the staff was very friendly and professional. Especially Front Desk Staff Med. Amine and Hajar. Breakfast and Service were also very good. Housekeeping made a great Job, everyone was helpful and very friendly. We loved the Pool and 24/7 Gym. The Spa Hamam Treatment and Massage by Ms.Meryam was incredible, it was one of the best Spa experience I ever had. It was the best Marriott and one of the best Hotels I have ever been.  Thank you Marriott Rabat!",5
I would like share one good thinks I had  massaging with Ms meryeme elbouadi  She's very highly motivated and she has good experience of messaging and relaxing my opinion if same one wanna  take it  message and relaxing.. go to hotel Marriott  rabat    specific Spa ask  about meryem  she will take care of you ..thank you  so much  I'll see you again as soon üíó,5
"It's a brand-new hotel, nice and clean. Breakfast has a good variety of food and drinks, only the egg station service was slow. One thing which the staff must learn is not to knock on the door of a guest if the 'Do Not Disturb' tag is displayed. I experienced the housekeeping staff kept knocking my door at 12.30am midnight to return my laundry when I was already fast asleep, with the 'Do Not Disturb' tag hung on the handle of my door. This is totally unacceptable. Also, there were tons of staff standing at the entrance to greet us when we arrived, but none of them offered help with our luggage. I hope the management would look into this matter seriously.",4
"This is probably one of the best hotels in Rabat, if not the best. It is evidently very new so it is well maintained and in top notch condition.   The rooms are spacious, the shower pressure is strong, the breakfast is really good and I tried the Spanish tapas by the pool which were good too. The pool is nice, quiet and the lounge chairs are thick and well padded so they literally feel like a bed mattress.   The hotel also has a small but sufficient gym with brand new high quality equipment. The spa was amazing as well. I tried an hour of the Moroccan hammam, followed by an hour of oil massage, and a hair blow dry at the salon. They are expensive services but you pay for a superb new facility and great service from the staff.  I recommend Mariam who was my spa specialist - she‚Ä¶",5
"I stayed at Rabat Marriot on a business trip for two weeks. By the time i left i felt like we are familyüòπ. Wonderful stay in every aspect. The hotel is well located in the center, many restaurants within walking distance, the room is super confortable (i will miss my morning routine drinking coffee and reading on the terrace). It has a beautiful pool side as well for relaxing after long working days.  I think the best asset the hotel has is its personnel. Amazing people, with a frank smile, helpful, welcoming and warm. Khadija Nadzi, Med. Amine, Samia at the front desk and the rest. Safae, Soukaina, and all the staff in the restaurant. Moussa and all the staff at the entrance. The housekeeping staff. My stay was made even more confortable thanks to all of them. Thank you and‚Ä¶",5
The Marriott Rabat is impeccable. My colleagues and I stayed at the this hotel for 4 days for conference. The staff are incredibly helpful and welcoming. Rooms are top notch. I highly recommend anyone and everyone stay here when in Rabat. The pool area is amazing. The hotel is located in the city center near a brand new shopping mall. I can't say enough positive things about my experience there.,5
The Marriott in Rabat was a wonderful experience.  From the moment we entered till the time we left we enjoyed our stay.  We had a Junior Suite for two nights with breakfast and Executive lounge access.  The room is amazing with the usual comfortable Marriott bed and an excellent rain shower.  We were greeted in reception by Abdulkarim who is just an amazing person and was helpful to us the entire stay.  He made check in and check out smooth and efficient.  The manager Nabil was seen every morning waking the property and greeting the guest.  Really this staff goes out of its way to make you feel welcome.  The property has many excellent food options including an outdoor restaurant called Ikatza which is headlined by Nezha the famous Moroccan chef.    The breakfast Buffett is‚Ä¶,5
"The hotel was less a month old when we checked in as a group. Our reservation was handled directly  by the sales team (Kenza, Zineb and Anass) and we were offered an unbeatable group booking rate. The first impression was indeed very pleasant, the sales team was accommodating, proactive and very prompt with their responses. Check in was handled smoothly by the front desk staff who were all smiles and welcoming. They were aware that we had to check out early the very next day, so they reassured us that the breakfast team will be ready for us by 6.30am the next day. The hotel is located right next to Arribat Centre, one of the better malls in Rabat. The decors and layout of the common  areas are  minimalist and functional. Rooms are bright and airy, the white/ beige theme makes‚Ä¶",5
"Rabat Marriott hosted us list past week, 6/22. Their attention to detail, exceptional service, and great food, made our stay memorable. This is a newly open hotel in Rabat with 5 star accommodations. By the end of the week, the staff knew my name and what I liked for breakfast. The conference center was also a great place for meetings considering it is newly opened and has the best technically available for meetings. I can not suggest this hotel enough for a great location, spotless facilities, and wonderful service.",5
"After staying in multiple 5 star Rabat hotels this has been the BEST by far!  Shout out to the excellent service, dining, cleanliness, and modern amenities in this hotel with a nice Moroccan touch of style. Being away from home, the entire staff have been welcoming. The management team, reservations team, culinary/restaurant team, lounge staff, concierge, and housekeeping are all top notch.  You will not regret staying at this Marriott property which is one of my favorites from 20+ years and 1200+ nights loyal to the brand.",5

"My second stay at the Marriott Rabat and I have to say that EVERYONE breathes hospitality in this property.  Incredible staff from the moment you step a foot till the moment of check out. Nabil, the rooms director alongside with Khadija, the front office manager, and Abdelhaq, the night manager, and the F&B director, mostapha,  are all hands on and keep a close eye on their guests to make sure that the stay is nothing but EXCELLENT.  As a titanium member that spends around 90 nights a year in Marriott brands, I have to say that these guys strive to make sure that your stay is as satisfying as a Ritz Carlton or St Regis. A huge thank you to the Marriott agdal staff( Amira, Ismael, Malak, Med Amine) for their genuine service. Keep up the Excellent work, you are all amazing at what you do ü´∂üèºü´∂üèº‚Ä¶",5
"The new Marriott in downtown Rabat is a delight. Opened for only 3 months or so, it‚Äôs an amazingly comfortable oasis in the middle of the city.  The hotel amenities and attention to detail are exactly what one would expect from a Marriott five star. From the breakfast to the gym/spa, all 5 star quality and service.  A special shout out to Mr. Amin from Meknes. Mr. Amin exemplified the Marriot five star standard, going out of his way to give us extremely good recommendations for our short stay in Rabat. We just wish we had had more time to enjoy the lobby, which is so inviting; we could easily have spent an afternoon ensconced reading and writing.  Really, a gem of a five star.",5
Great 3 day visit at the Marriott.  Looks very impressive on the inside.  Great selection of restaurants.  With a great breakfast.  Champions bar was a let down as it was so Smokey in there.  Spacious rooms with good amenities.  Just need to sort out the pick up and drop off area.  Was always crazy in the mornings and evenings.  Not very well thought out in its design.,5
"It was a quick business trip but very nice hotel. Will explore more next time. Food was good. One comment, could have been warmer when it got to my room.  Rooms are spacious,  very clean and the staff obviously well trained. 5 stars overall. I'll be back.",5
"The service at this hotel was unbelievably good, as was its cleanliness, wellness facilities, pool and multiple restaurants.  We were there for a conference and were very well supported by remarkable staff. Special recognition to Front Office manager Khadjia Nadzi - both charming and very capable.",5
"Our family of 3 adults and one teen had the pleasure of spending a night at Rabat Marriott on our arrival in Morocco for a 10-day tour - this hotel stay made for a terrific start to the trip!  The hotel is brand new, having opened only a few months ago.  That said, it is the incredible service throughout that really shines, in particular the warm welcome we received from Nabil.  We also used the spa for a traditional hamam, which ended up being the best one of our entire trip.  Our only regret is that we were only there for one night!",5
"I had an excellent experience at the Mariott in Rabat. The staff were very professional and accommodating. Nabil, the director helped me book my last minute reservation, and had the pleasure of meeting him in person as well. He went above and beyond to accommodate me and made sure I had an enjoyable stay. The hotel is ideally located in the center of Rabat and within walking distance to shops and restaurants. The outdoor pool, the rooms and the spa are all breathtaking. The hotel is fairly new and I was astonished at the very small details throughout the property. I highly recommend this place. I will most definitely stay here again next time I come back to Morocco.",5
"We have been to Morocco several times, me and my wife and to be honest this is the first time we felt the Moroccan hospitality deeper; the hotel is stunning with all its facilities and services, the breakfast was nice, the swimming pool also was beautiful with the restaurant ikatza we really loved the food there. We would like to thank and appreciate the lady from the reception Ms Samia took really good care of us, she is an incredible host full of energy and kindness, she gave us a list of places to visit in Rabat and also where to eat nice Moroccan dishes that we really loved, whenever we leave the hotel for a visit or when we comeback she is there to greet us and makes us feel home. Thank you so much for your hospitality and we are telling our friends and family about your hotel and specially your people. We are coming back.‚Ä¶",5
