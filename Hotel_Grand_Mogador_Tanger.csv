"We spent a very delightful stay in this hotel.  The trip over on the bullet train from Rabat was easy.  Once in Tangier, the people and culture were fascinating experiences.  This hotel has amazing spacious rooms and the views are breathtaking. You can hear the ocean at night and walking around the narrow corridors of the city discovering all the little shops and restaurants are an absolute must!",5
"A pigsty in every term! Absolutely avoid this place.  Holes in the pool everywhere, food very scarce and generally very un-hygienic.   Photos are all a farce, don't know how Tripadvisor has not red flagged this so-called Hotel!!! A disgrace to a lovely country like Morocco.",1
You are paying for the view only The hotel not Worth  the price not worth five stars furniture very old no coffee maker  in the room no water TV is not working carpet very old and smells very disappointed we will never come back include his pictures of the carpet dirt and also the cracks on the tub,1
"The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Perfect location, great amenities, and fantastic service.   Yassin from the concierge/reception made our stay phenomenal and memorable - Thank you. We will never forget you ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  I can highly recommend to stay at this hotel.",5
"Not the best stay, Water was brown , cleaning wasn’t up to standard ! No amenities in room . Drilling early in the morning From outside ! A manager Hicham was very bad .  No understanding no care in the world. This guy is a bad Manager he should be helping the people! Not going back ",1
"Excellent service! By far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed. Such great value for money, although it is a bit far from the Médina it’s a short and cheap taxi ride to all the best places in Tangier. It’s situated in a very quiet and safe spot. The staff go above and beyond for all guests and are always willing to help out. Thank you guys so much for a very enjoyable stay",5
"Very helpful and friendly staff, beautiful suite with great sea view, breakfast has more than you could ever need, all of this at a very affordable rate.  Any minor issues were dealt with immediately and in a very professional manner.  You can walk into the city along the beach but it is also convenient for parking your car if you have one.  I travel a lot.  This hotel easily compares to any upmarket hotel you could be staying at in Europe but would pay a lot more money for.  I have stayed at other hotels of this level and prefer this one.  I will certainly be back.",5
"Last night was a nightmare !  Wind sounds , chairs moving in the balcony , the air flow moves the curtains..  the windows has no thermal  or sonor isolation ! We couldn't sleep the whole night !  I woke up with fever and flu ..  Besides, we had to call the reception to fix the bathroom twice ..   I will never come back here again !",1
Although the location is not handy for the old town and despite the fact that housekeeping was a little tardy here I found the staff friendly and the food very good. Excellent standard Moroccan cuisine for evenings or breakfasts was a pleasant surprise. Good facilities in a large hotel complex.,4
"The majority of staff were very helpful and explained to us certain customs of Tangiers, like not being able to kiss in Public. The Breakfasts were very good, but Ive been in many other 5 star hotels and the breakfasts in the past have been plentiful and obviously don't expect a full English breakfast in this hotel especially. Kamal was very helpful and spoke very good English at breakfast times. The rooms are more like 3 star quality and ours was definitely not 5 star quality. The carpets were very worn, but cleaned daily due to the sand from our footwear. You could feel that tis building and its interior contents needed to be updated, especially the room furniture etc. There were no Mini Bar contents in the fridge etc and no Tea or coffee making facilities. To use the indoor Pool and other facilities were chargeable and we didn't bother paying. There was also two female staff that had very bad attitudes and unable to speak English in the indoor pool area/reception. They put me off from visiting that hotel ever again. The most frustrating part was the majority of the staff not being able to speak English. French and Arabic are the most commonly used languages in Tangiers. …",3
"This was a very comfortable hotel and the sea view is gorgeous. Lovely breakfast in a beautiful room. Nice pool and beach access right there. But the carpet makes the place look outdated and the carpet was very dirty in our room. Giant bathroom but the water wasn’t really hot and because the tub is very big it is hard to get in and out of the shower. There is ample parking and it’s easy to get a taxi as well. Overall, we had a nice stay.",4
"We had a corner suite with great view, but Rooms outdated and filthy. Toilets and showers didnt work. Water pipe broke flooding room staff didnt even clean it up. Service was extremely slow. Drinks at pool took over 90 minutes and ice 45 minutes. Breakfast very average. No alcohol served in the hotel.",2
"I cannot say enough good things about the staff at this hotel. They are kind, courteous and bend over backwards to make sure that the guests comfortable and happy. We had quite a few things go wrong during our trip but they were so accommodating and helpful that it really didn't matter.",5
"Exceptionally helpful and kind staff. They assisted us with finding a taxi, set up a tour for Chefchaouen, and wonderful service at breakfast. The bedroom was spacious and clean. The ONLY reason why it wouldn’t be five stars for me is the location. It was a long walk to the center and it was difficult to get a taxi there. However that wasn’t the hotel’s fault! I just would have enjoyed a more convenient location. I would recommend the hotel if you don’t mind it isn’t in the center of everything. Beautiful views. ",4
The hotel was nice and clean. We had a sea-view room and it was large! The staff was kind and helpful. The hotel arranged a shuttle service that picked us up from the airport and brought us to the hotel.,5
"The lobby was fantastic, but, the hotel is a little older/dated...  I did not have a fireplace in my room, and the towels are not the best; but, the staff was absolutely awesome!  We had a room that faced the Mediterranean Sea!!  How beautiful the view was!!!  The young lady at the front desk, Ms. Hajar Anzaoui, was spectacular!  Also, the gentlemen who waited on us in the restaurant, Fattin Mohomed and Kamal Ragoui, were phenomenal.  The young man, who I thought NEVER went home - because he was there in the mornings and afternoons/evenings, was the best doorman ever - Mohamed Ould Hamra!  Bravo to you all!  You guys made our trip/hotel stay better!!  Berlinda Williams-Strong",4
"I invited a business partner who wanted to stay in alcohol free hotel. The breakfast was disappointing, the gym most of the equipment are old and broken. Cleaning was below average. Not welcoming atmosphere, beds are not comfortable, towels are old. This should be 3 stars. ",1
"This hotel is just awesome. The rooms are nice, well decorated, view on both side is good ( one on the sea, the other on the mountains). I really loved how the staff talks politely and room service is always available. They have good quality food and a nice pool.  Loved the place!",5
"Grand lobby which is beautifully decorated. We had a nice large room with a balcony and a great view of the ocean. Beds are much too soft which required sleeping on the floor. Meals were so so. It's a long taxi ride into Tanger & the main activities thus  the hotel is expensive & inconvenient. Staff is very very friendly & helpful in cleaning the rooms, at breakfast & hailing a taxi.",3
"Looks like fairly new hotel. Room was very big with separate sitting room and bedroom. Clean. Good views of the ocean.  We wanted some hot water/kettle and told the reception when we checked in. We waited 1 hr but no kettle/hot water and realised there was no phone to call room service. My husband had to walk down n asked for the kettle/hot water. An hour later, still nothing. We went out for dinner n on the way out, told reception (we still had no room phone), told him that we'll collect the hot water/kettle on the way back to our room.  When we came back, reception guy said will bring the hot water up but after another hour, nothing, so we gave up. Breakfast the next say was ample, lots of choices. But a mere hot water/kettle was unattainable on 3 occasions. ",3
"First day electricity fall.. had to call twice for them to fix day. Second day realized the door not getting locked, 3 times had to ask it to be fixed, had to go 3 times for them to synchronize the keys, then found out the door can only get open from inside..  the hotel is not functioned",2
"Having spent the last 36 hours at the beautiful Grand Mogador Hotel, in Tangier we have only praise and thanks for this Hotel. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with a warm smile, given complimentary Mint Tea, and shown to our huge room and huge bed. The Staff are friendly and most helpful, and the food is also very good. Kamal the friendly waiter makes the best Berber Mojitos and was never far when we needed something. Best things: massive bed, friendly staff, excellent pool beside beach.  Cannot recommend this enough! ",5
"I am having the most amazing time of my life at the Mogodor. I don't think there are friendlier people than the ones working here. We are being treated like Royalty. We are so pampered we don't want to go back to Canada. I have used lots of hotels services through out my life and usually I don't leave any reviews because I don't like to talk bad about anyone or any place. I am so happy I wanted to express my gratitude to everyone in the hotel hoping they will read my review.  I have a special thank you to Kamal from the coffee shop for his amazing cappuccino and service. Fatiha at the Spa, Lamyia at the breakfast restaurant. Hajar at the reception. You are all AMAZING!!!. I really feel bad that I don't know all the names but I hope my endless thanks and regards will reach all of…",5
"Stunning ocean views, the sunsets are superb to see.  The rooms are certainly spacious but apart from that.....they are very tired.  Desperately in need of a good clean and revamp, even the corridors are soleless.  Do be aware that though the website says this hotel has a ‘bar’.....the ENTIRE hotel is alcohol free.",3
"Before I booked a room at this hotel, I searched for a hotel with standards that suits me, and I did not find the best of this hotel, especially the wonderful location and  the services available in it, such as a swimming pool and a spa. Most of all, that beautiful treatment at reception, especially Mrs. Hajer, where she did an upgrade the room to a nice suite, and Mrs. Shaimaa who gave me the morrocan tea as a wellcome drink and escorted me to find out about the hotel's facilities. They are really classy, respectful and very nice. I recomment this hotel and I'll never book next time in another hotel.  Thank you so much",5
"We arrived yesterday , found the staff very helpful and a nice hotel to stay at. Very Morocco, our room was not ready so they provided a free upgrade to a great room ! The breakfast was very good and once again staff very helpful and friendly. There was no alcohol served but not a major problem as casino and local restaurant very near. Pool area good ! So all in all good stay , different culture.",4
"This is a passable 3 star hotel, but a deplorable 5 star hotel.  The hotel. Pretty but a little shabby. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, although the couple we were travelled with had a much smaller room. The bath in our companions’ room had heavily chipped enamel, and there was an electric socket above the sink(!) in our room which was hanging off the wall(!!). The breakfast is served on a mezzanine floor which is only accessed by a spiral staircase so if you have mobility issues you need to expect to pay for breakfast in your room everyday. The sea view was excellent and the sound of the waves comforting, but with little soundproofing the noise of dodgy plumbing and the call to prayer was annoying. This is a dry hotel so the range of ‘cocktails’ is actually what…",2
"The hotel has a great location near to Malabata cap, the staff are very helpful and kind. The breakfast was copious with a varied buffet... The rooms are very clean and comfortable it would be excellent if the proof sonorisation was better.  I recommend this hotel for a short pleasant stay",4
"Will never stay or recommend this hotel to anyone. Do not stay here! We had money stolen from our hotel room - 800 Dirhams. We went to the spa at the hotel and while we were there, someone entered our room and scratched in our handbags while cleaning our room. When we told the hotel reception staff money is missing from our handbags while were were at the spa, they said the cleaner told them we were in the room while she was cleaning. We were not in the room. We were at the spa. The hotel staff said we were lying and refused to do anything about it. Do not stay at this hotel. Booking.com were also completely unhelpful with this situation!",1
"The hotel amenities are few.  Not much to write about.  This is a basic hotel which is a little on the shabby side.  The furniture was beaten up, the bed uncomfortable.  The showers an impossible design which sprays water all over the floor and must be an HSE hazard .  The stucco on the outside of the balcony was falling off.  The place is really not worth the money, although the sea view was lovely.  I had to call down twice for towels so that I could have a shower.  The kicker was that the hotel was dry - not that alcohol is needed but that I would have been happier knowing that before I pre-purchased my room online..",2
"The hotel foyer is quite lovely and the reception female staff were wonderful and friendly.  We got a sea facing room as a birthday upgrade.  The check in was a little delayed but we were taken to the room. The room was old and had a stale smoke smell and a broken toilet seat but the view was stunning.  The breakfast was good but they didn't understand the concept of English tea.   On my birthday, we spent the day at the hammam and had massages and went out at around 4. We went shopping and I noticed that I was missing 600 dirhams from my wallet. We got back to the hotel and turned out my sister was missing 200 dirhams from her purse in the room so we reported this to the night manager and they promised to take it up with the cleaning ladies. Next morning, before checking out,…",3
"We stayed here for two nights at the end of a long journey through Morocco. And this Place is really not worth the money it costs. The Rooms and everything is old and old fashioned. But the worst think is: the walls are incredibly thin. You hear every single word from the rooms around. And if you stay in a room with ""mountain view"" it sounds like you sleep in the middle of the road - so noisy!   The staff is very nice and friendly but very very slow. The breakfast is okay but The breakfastarea is not clean at all and the furtinture is really messed up.  All in all this Hotel was the only dissapointment in morocco - and the most expensive one.  We stayed in a five Star Hotel in Essaouira which was cheaper and so much better than The Grand Mogador. Our best experiences were the…",1
"We stayed at the Mogador Tanger for two nights, along with my spouse and two kids; aged four & five; and we'll definitely keep a great souvenir of the trip. As a young family we had all we asked for. The location is perfect, the view is breathtaking and the pool was the children's best spot. The suit was quite cosy and spacious. Special regards to Saad, Yusra and Mohammed from breakfast; for their kindness and hospitality.",5
"e booked at the Grand Mogador to spend a family week end with another couple and regretted our choice:  1/ When we reached (with a toddler and new born) we faced strong winds (Nature of the city) while offloading the car. The watchman was observing the whole painful scene and did not react. We offloaded a full 500L trunk on our own, with nobody's support.  2/ Once Inside (We reached at 12pm), we tried to get hold of our room, which was not ready (We knew it would be the case as check in starts at 2pm, but hoped a room would be released earlier), anyways in order to ""buy"" time we asked where the restaurant was, the lady at the counter could not answer at first and oriented us towards the breakfast area at ground level, before her colleague corrects her to indicate ""the first…",2
"Many of us, who travel frequently, must have wondered - at least once - about the criteria underlying the classification of hotels, namely the allocation of stars.  I had done it a few times, but this hotel was the one that most puzzled me!  Quality of sleep It is amazing that during a whole week we could not get one single night of a full relaxing sleep. Either because cars were buzzing their horns all night, motorbikes accelerating like hell, or ambulances going back and forth until 5 in the morning. If that was not enough every single day about 4 in the morning, prays were ‘broadcasted’ from a mosque nearby, by means of a loudspeaker! Adding to this, the last night the wind was blowing so strong that the door to the balcony, which had a finger thick gap to the gutter,…",2
"We stayed here for a week as a large family group including children at the end of July. The hotel is clean and we were upgraded to a suite which suited us perfectly with 2 small children. We had lovely sea views. The staff were very attentive to our needs. We had a staff liaison which was useful.   Sun beds were always available. Towels are provided around the pool. Breakfast was served until 11am which was good if you wanted to lie in.   Location is about a half hour walk to the main restaurants which didn't bother us as we enjoy walking. There is also a restaurant called Cappucino a 5 minute walk. With the noise level in Morocco at night you will probably welcome being a bit away from the centre!   Beach is nice, flat and shallow perfect for children. Try the sardines for…",3
"Hotel with 100 stars.I have stayed in all the top five star hotels in the world from Dorchester to Peninuslas, But friends trust me, the service you get in Grand mogador  is the best you can get . If I had to give stars to this hotel , I wud have given it all the stars of the universe. As every staff memeber of this hotel is a superstar in himself. Superb service, Amazing Ambience and Picterseque View. Thanks to GM madame Aline and his wonderful team to make my stay so pleasant and peaceful. Thanks and Love for all my friends in Mogodaor. See u soon. Saurabh Jain, London",5
We booked the mogador on the advertising  of a fabulous hotel on the beach in tangiers with a bar as i was celebrating my birthday Warm welcome Upgrade for a large room suite But The bar is only serving carrot juice and water. We respect every religion but the hotel should warn customers that it is respecting muslims religious obligations even for foreigners Large swimming pool but polluted by aggressive 120 decibels rap music with french very aggressive worlds Music so loud no way to make a nap Kitchen cuisine very sub par and infernal delays to get served After three days we moved to the hilton city center which is perfect by all respects and delicious cuisine and fabulous personnel.  And 50 pc cheaper....!!!!€,1
"Absolutely nice ocean view from the hotel,but they lack service and hotel maintenance.  It took a very long time to check in and the shower was not working propery with the mold on bathtub wall. Even though the all the stuff was nice we spent a long time to get a towel for a pool. This hotel location is more than half an hour walk to city center but it was nice to walk along the beach.  Neither the hotel nor nearby Carrefour carries alcohol. If you want to get one you need to go to the one in the city center or the super market near airport.",3
"The Grand Mogador is a beautiful hotel with a very friendly and welcoming staff. We were upgraded at check-in to a wonderful suite. It was very spacious with one full bathroom, and one half bathroom. The suite was on the road and although it was very clean and comfortable, there was loud street noise during the night. As westerners, we were surprised that men and women could not use the indoor pool at the same time (purely a result of cultural ignorance). Additionally, common areas of the hotel had a conservative feel/atmosphere. Other western women may feel most comfortable if conservative clothing is worn. Breakfast was wonderful and thoroughly enjoyed by us all each morning we were there.",4
Stayed one night at this hotel. Waited a long time at reception for some unknown reason but were served mint tea.  We were upgraded to a suite for another unknown reason and it was fabulous.  Super King bed with perfect mattress. A gorgeous sofa and 2 bathrooms. Balcony and stunning sea views.  To make the most of the room we ordered room service. Food was awful but edible.  Breakfast your usual hotel fare.  Would stay here again if wanting a more European type accommodation. If not find some place else.  This is a Muslim Country but the no alcohol ban even in your room is a little outdated considering there is a blatant casino just down the road.  But one can survive without alcohol. ,4
"Big hotel grounds, Big pool with friendly staff. Rooms are clean and spacious.  Need a taxi to go to medina or centreville.  As coffee in the morning is a must for me, would have liked to have complimentary coffee in the rooms as most hotels do.",4
"Went as a family in low season so not many guests in the hotel, upgraded to a suite which gave good space and great sea views.  Freshly made breakfast crepes and omelets were good. Husband and son liked the indoor pool but had men/women opening times.  Hammam was also free but sauna and other facilities to be paid for. Hotel should offer flat rate taxi service or even a shuttle into centre of town or medina. And hot water and tv cable facilities in the morning seem to have a timing element though.",4
"This has to be the worst hotels in the world, I'm not sure what 5 stars means to them, no alcohol is allowed or served on the premises, restaurant is closed at 9pm on New Year's Eve, the hotel is empty no surpris service is bad very unprofessional, this sort of hotels will not survive in our modern tourist industry. If you want ever go to Morocco never use this sort of hotels!!",1
"English translation below:  أقمت في هذا الفندق في زيارة عائلية لأكثر من أسبوع، منظر البحر من الغرفة كان جميل جدل ومرافق الفندق ""السبا- اللاونج والمسابح الداخلية والخارجية "" كانت ممتازة. بوفيه الافطار كان جيد ويمكن تطويره وتحسينه من اكثر من ناحية. جميع موظفين الفندق الذين صادفتهم كانوا مضيافين ومتعاونين، باستثناء احدى موظفات الاستقبال والتي كان اسلوبها سيئا جدا.   لازم استخدام سيارة للذهاب لوسط المدينة، جو الفندق للاستجمام والاسترخاء.  I stayed with my family for more than 1 week , the sea view was amazing and the amenities of the hotel ""spa- lounge and 2 pools indoor/outdoor"" were great. The breakfast buffet was fair, it can be more improved and organised. All hotel staff were helpful and hospitable, except a receptionist lady who had a bad manners. You need a ride to get to…",3
We stayed 5 nights in this wonderful Hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and fulfilled all our wishes. The view is just stunning! Also the rooms are tasteful and clean. Breakfast offers a good amount of choices and was always fresh. The only criticism I would have is maybe the restaurant. we had dinner there once and the food was very average including dry fish and meat. The cold dishes on the other hand were delicious!,4
"From the moment I come here they mixed up my whole family rooms over charged us an extra £600 for each room the stuff at reception was by far the most unhelpful people I have ever meet! the food at the hotel is completely rubbish no choice of food and very dry plain food not something I expected from a 4star hotel & plus it was over priced But I should have known because my family was the only people that ate food that evening, I really wish I had not come here!!! Crap start to our family holiday ",1
"The location of hotel right on the ocean front gives it a tremendous lift above its level of class.  The services are acceptable and the breakfast fair is average. Rooms are large and clean with lots of cabinet spaces. Also, the hotel boasts  a very large car parking space.  It is a fair distance from the town center, about  2km but it is smack next door to the casino for those enamored by gaming ! ",3
"Stayed here for 2 nights after wedding, arrived at 5 am in the morning after my wedding to be old I have the wrong hotel ?? (I had checked in during the day) Breakfast was ok.. got upgraded to a suite which was a plus, was spacious and had lovely views.",3
"This hotel was so nice, Room very clean, staff helpful, beautiful view on the beach, large room with a long balcony. The pool was warm I did know if its a heated pool but it felt pleasant. The have a very big pool. It was the best days of our vacation in Morocco.",5
Beautiful hotel located on the Mediterranean . Very comfortable. Friendly staff. Extremely clean. Reasonably priced. And a great location. The balcony of the hotel was very romantic and offered a magnificent view of the Mediterranean. Access to the beach was not easy and therefore it was difficult to make full use of it.,5
"My friends, sister, and I stayed at the hotel for three days. When we arrived we were greeted warmly by the staff. While we waited for them to prepare our rooms they had refreshments and mint tea waiting for us in the lounge area! The hotel was very beautiful, especially the lobby ceiling. The hotel has both an outdoor and indoor pool. The hotel offers spa and gym services. My friends use the facilities and were very pleased. The breakfast in the morning offered many delicious options and was worth the 15pp charge. I had the mountain view which was nice to wake up to in the morning. My friend had a ocean view which was amazing! The rooms were spacious. Three adults shared my room and we never felt crowded. The beds in the room are comfortable, however the roll away bed we had in…",4
"My husband and I stayed the night at the Grand Mogador and from the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we were treated like royalty. Haajar at the front desk was extremely professional and kind, and even though we had no reservation, we got a beautiful room. Just to give you a heads up, the double room even though it states it's a king size bed its actually 2 twin beds pushed together, so if you're a couple, you'd be better off getting the suite. Once we realized the bed situation we called the front desk and were instantly upgraded to the suite and everyone apologized for the misunderstanding. Very very clean hotel, with a delicious fresh breakfast and Moroccan tea. The room had a  magnificent sea view and it was so amazing we didn't want to leave. We will definitely be…",5
"This hotel was fabulous.  Staff very friendly, and component.  Breakfast was fair.  Would have liked more hot offerings.  Made to order omelets were good.  The carpet in room was very stained, but it was very clean.  Would stay here again.",5
"We were given a surprise upgrade to a suite.  It has an amazing view from the bedroom as well as the reception. We spent one entire day just relaxing in the hotel as we loved the view, the atmosphere and the facilities.  The restaurant staff went out of the way to make food that we wanted even though it was not on the menu.  Spa and other facilities were also very good. The reception would book taxis for any place that you want to go. They would also help you with the ideal taxi fare in case would like to go out on your own and enjoy the experience of haggling for a taxi.  The staff is extremely helpful, the rooms are tastefully decorated and the overall experience makes it an excellent place to stay.",5
"Great Hotel with excellent service. My wife and I stayed in 3rd floor, which is a sea view room. The view from our room was breathtaking. Highly recommended for couples. The staff and breakfast were also great.  Loved everything in Mogador.",5
"The best part of the hotel was the doorman who ensured the taxi driver did not rip me off. I was having trouble with the taxi driver and looked at the doorman for assistance. He obliged. I was very, very grateful.   The desk attendant held our passports and instructed us to sit for some tea. Thinking there may be a delay I watched her and she was just standing there doing nothing.  Wondering why we were waiting and got up to ask. She didn't have an answer. I asked for our passports and she retrieved them from the cash register! This doesn't make sense!   The room was clean. The bathroom was not. There was soap and shampoo remnants on the tub surround and hairs in the tub. The mirror was not clean.   There was one outlet in the entire room to plus in our electronic devices…",3
"This hotel is excellent . I was in room 5010 and I had a Sea View and a Street View . The room was huge with 2 bathrooms, 3 balconies , 2 TVs, 6 chairs and a couch . The bed was big and comfy . The wifi was fast and worked in the entire hotel . The Spa in the basement is an extra added benefit. The staff was friendly and helpful for my entire stay and went out of their way to accommodate me . Nothing bad to say at all. I would definitely stay here again . ",5
"We stayed just for one night on the 14th January on our way back from a tour of the northern coastal area. The staff are so very friendly and helpful, and the reception staff in particular have impeccable English.  The location is a short walk from the town centre, in a quiet and relaxing area of the city. There is a lot of construction work along the beach, and were very glad we had chosen this hotel to stay in, away from the chaos. The Hotel reception area is contemporary and stylish with spectacular views out across the sea towards town of Tangier, with the Spanish coast visible in the distance.  The room we had was with a sea view, and  balcony ,overlooking the pool, which looks a good size. The bed was huge and very comfortable, and the bath is also a good size.The…",5
"What a lovely view (if you select a sea view room). In the chilly off-season, we were greeted with a warm welcome.  The hospitality begins as you reach the door. Attendants carry your bags, and invite you to have Moroccan tea and cookies as your registration is completed. The hotel offers complimentary wi-fi, cable television (but not much in English), spa services, and indoor and outdoor pools. In the bright and airy breakfast dining room  you can enjoy a buffet of pastries, cheeses, and Moroccan treats. The rooms vary in size. The beds are very comfortable  Two things about the design: 1) additional electrical outlets would be helpful, and 2) the bathroom sink is situated within the vanity too close to the wall, and adding to the problem, the towel bar has been placed in front…",4
"From the moment we checked in, we received a great welcome from the kind staff. We were given a room in the first floor which in fact is a mezzanine but the ocean view was still awesome. The breakfast is delicious and the service given is worthy.",5
"This hotel is located on the beach facing the ocean, in a typical Moroccan setting at 5 mins by cab to the city . The staff is ADORABLE doing everything they can to help you being well and relax. Our week at this place was a sheer bliss : From the welcoming arrival with tea, cookies, juices until the departure, we had the perfect service. The suite that we had was perfected located facing the ocean and we slept all the week with the opened windows listening to the waves and breathing the ocean air. We didn't have any dinner at this place but the breakfast in the morning is very good with all the possible choices for every culture. Nice and quiet. Perfect stay. We visited other hotels like The Mirage, Villa Josephine and so on, but will come back next time to this one.",5
It's very nice hotel and it's more than nice is too elegant  As soon as you entered the hotel you r going to be surprised with the nice staff in the reception . And they meet you with big smile and with nice tradition moroccan green mint tea And contribution nice macron and sweet And with assistance manager her name (karima) she is so nice and very very helpful  To assist you with any question  And even the manger he is on the floor to help and assist the Custmer  And I have been traveling everywhere I never found manger and assistance manager on the floor all the time since in the morning till night Very warm atmosphere in the hotel And the view it's unbelievable it's on the sea straight away  All most all the rooms on the sea view  Very very very quite hotel for family who…,5
"The hotel is very new and with a great view. The rooms are good and modern and very confortable. It has a great outside pool. Everything is very nice but the most special thing about this hotel is the people that work there, they make you feel special from the moment you get in and they sit you by the lobby with complimentary macaroons, cookies, chocolate truffles, water, juice, mint tea etc. It's really the service that sets this hotel apart. The restaurant manager was amazing and attentive, the reception staff always impecable and the manager on duty restless. This is a 5 star hotel because of the people that work there!",5
rooms were clean and I had a nice sea view. The breakfast was adequate I did feel that it was quite expensive compared to other hotels I have stayed in Morocco. Staff were nice and friendly. The hotel is quiet and more family orientated,3
"My name is john Payne..my last three days at this hotel I was very sick from bad food at McDonald's. Ms. Haraj the concierge and cleaning woman Ms. Happiness and doorman Sami took very good care of me Sami took me to the Rx pharmacy and Ms. Haraj took extra efforts to help me regain my lost luggage. Sea View is absolutely the best view in Tanger. Each night lulled by the surf and soothed by the wonderful breeze there's no need to shut the balcony door. Fortunately I was not sick during my whole visit...yet while VERY sick Haraj and Sami took special care of me. Great breakfast buffet and excellent maid service.  A great value and great experience.

Amenities are a very gracious check-in and breakfast staff & omellete woman.  And excellent security and doormen.  My room is awesome with the gentle and mystical caress of The mediteranean surf and breeze.,5
"Moved from another hotel in Tanger to this one and was pleased I did. Hajar, the receptionist and all the hotel staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I had a lovely room with balcony overlooking the sea and being there during Ramadan, it was nice to be able to experience the different types of food that were served at the evening meal. Nice place, nice people!",4
"The room is spacious, clean, and gorgeous. The service is nice, helpful, and the staff were extremely welcoming and warm. The pros are in abundance, and the prices are reasonable. Right in front of the beach.",5
"We have just come back from this hotel today and promised we would write a review, so here goes. The  staff are all extremely friendly and helpful, the Hotel is spotless on the inside and outside, the pool area is large and well situated, our room was very bright and very well set out and spotlessly clean. The spa, massage, sauna and gym area's were simply amazing. The food was good, although I think they could do with a bit more variety. For me and my wife personally, the one down side was it was an Alcohol free Hotel which we had not realised when we booked, but as I said, this is a personnel observation. The Wi-Fi was also very intermittent, hopefully they will sort this out in the near future.   Overall a great Hotel.",5
"We habve been there for one night during the Budapest-Bamako Rallye. The staff was very friendly and the service was good as well, although the hotel got ""raided"" by apporox. 80 participants of the Rallye. Rooms were clean and had a perfect view to the sea.  A place to recommend!",5
"It rained pretty much the whole time we were here (mid-late Feb), apparently this is normal weather this time of year close to the atlantic/med mixing. The wind whistled into the room all night, just slightly louder than the crashing waves. Because the balcony doors did not close properly (or lock at all) the sound was very loud and the room was cold even with the heater full on. Add to that the astoundingly poor WiFi in the room and the shower that needed to be run for a good 5 minutes before becoming hot(ish) and you can see why I was not impressed. We had the meetings in the hotel and the WIFi in there was also very poor (we seemed to be the only people in the hotel so it was not overtaxed). The whole hotel was pretty cold actually.  The lifts were veeeery slow so I took to…",2
My wife and my 2 kids checked in on Dec 19 for 2 days what a wonderful and full of smile welcome we got and felt at home room was very clean and and brackfast was amazing the server in brackfast are are just amazing people all of them serve with smile and we felt loved. Front desk I think his name is Yousf is friendly and always go out of his way to help we highly recommend this hotel to family with  Kids.  Anwar Aman USA ,5
"After our stay, I have been asked by a customer service guy, to write my review on this hotel, very honestly, it's a perfect place  Very friendly staff, all our requests have been processed immediately, clean and beautiful rooms, very comfortable double bed, flat screen TV with many channels, large balcony and sea view, rich breakfast buffet ... we ll be back for sure",5
" Beautiful view, especially during sunset,  excellent and friendly staff, great location, clean, and large rooms. The restaurant, is self-service, with lots of choices. My kids loved the pools. If I vsit Tangier again, I will come back for sure.",5
"Me and my family : wife and 9 years old son , found that this an Excellent hotel.. very good services.. polite and helpful staff. .We really enjoyed our stay at this fantastic hotel.  The room, food& location were top..",5
"Beautiful hotel, excellent facilities, great staff very helpful and polite. Fantastic views from our balcony and our room was almost like a honeymoon suite! A little out of the way but definitely would recommend others!",5
"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Mogador for a week on vacation to visit Tangier and explore the surrounding area. We were both first time visitors to Tangier and to Morocco.  We were greeted warmly on arrival by the doorman; we generally found the door staff to be very helpful and friendly throughout our stay - particularly when it came to hailing petit taxis for us.  Having paid a little extra for a sea view room we were first shown to a 'mountain view' room - a mistake which was quickly rectified, and we were shown to a sea view room on the top floor with a stunning view over the Bay of Tangier.   The room was remarkably large, as was the bathroom. There was a good amount of wardrobe space, a decent safe, a desk (strangely without a proper chair), full length mirror, and two…",4
"I was in Tangier on a business trip so having wi-fi access was extremely important.  For the 2 nights I was there, wi-fi was spotty and whenever I asked about it, the front desk would say ""Tomorrow OK"".  Well, it never got ""OK"".  Service at the hotel was inconsistent.  The room I was given was HUGE.  There was a living area, 2 bathrooms, etc.  Didn't quite know what to do with so much space but some people may appreciate it.  The hotel seems quite old so things seemed quite worn and dated.  The seaview was great and the pool was huge and good.  Breakfast spread was adequate.   The location is quite a way from the city center so it's quieter but if you want to head out there explore you'll have to find a petit taxi to and fro and costs about 10 - 20ish dirhams depending on which…",3
"The room at the Ryad Mogador are huge but there is little of interest inside them:  -No desk or workchair -No water kettle for tea   -No fridge -No ceiling lights despite the huge room (the room looks nothing like the ""professional photos"" on the tripadvisor page.)  -No unused plugs -No curtain or guard to prevent water from spilling onto the bathroom floor during shower and frequently, no internet, due to regular outages   I sent three items of clothing for laundry through the hotel, and two of them came back missing buttons  There are two good things about this hotel.  One is the terrific view of the city and bay.  The other is the huge pool—it must be 35 or 40 meters long.  And no restrictions on using it outside the designated opening hours.  But don't expect to use the gym…",2
"We got a good deal from eBookers and really enjoyed our stay for this value. We got upgraded to Senior sweet by paying 300dh (30 euros) extra. The room was magnificent! Amazing views to the sea, only sound the waves. The room and the view really deserve 5 stars. Also the pool - empty, clean and huge! Bit of complaints though: We had to pay extra 10 euros (normally they charge 15 euros) per person for breakfast. eBookers reservation didn't say a word about breakfast and therefore it was bit of surprise.  Also the breakfast is not worthy of 5 stars. The warm milk for coffee was old 3 days in a row. We asked to change it but i'm not sure if they did it. The sortiment of food also wasn't really interesting. You could buy breakfast in any cafe in Morocco for less than 5 euros. The…",4
"The hotel was absolutely beautiful, right on the beach. The only negative part was we did travel during Ramadan which is the fasting period for them, this meaning that everything is closed and practically without life. The food was horrible as well as the coffee which costs 30 Dirhams (a bloody fortune). The City itself is not one of my favorite, I highly recommend traveling further south because people will rip you off here, a taxi ride shouldn't be any more than 30/40 Dirhams so be careful and make sure they turn on the taximeter!!  I do have to say that the man in charge of the hotel has an amazing level in English, he lived in Florida and New York, and he was absolutely wonderful to us!",4
"We stayed one night here and it was wonderful.  The ""sea view"" rooms have an unobstructed view the port and sunset.   The rooms were comfortable and nicely equipped.  We ordered room service and ate our dinner on the terrace.  For the price we paid, we really got a lot of value.  I would come back in a heartbeat.  Breakfast is luxurious, but 100 mad per person if you don't have in the room rate.  Staff is sweet,  courteous, and mostly French and arabic speaking (when I visited). If you don't have a word of either, you may run into minor trouble, but they will find someone to help you.  Note: taxis call this place ""hotel mogador"" and the price for a taxi from the main train station should be no more than 50 mad.  Probably much less.",5
"I stayed here for a few days at the end of May 2014.   It is a lovely hotel, very clean and as in most hotels, the maids are the nicest people.  The rooms are plush, but designed for taller people than myself. I'm 5'2"" and it was an effort to climb into the lush marble bath, and I had to stand on my tip toes to brush my teeth!   I ate there a couple of times and the food was very very nice, and a good sized serving.  The staff around the hotel and pool are a bit stand offish, they need to know there's a difference between being invasive and avoiding eye contact when you are trying to get their attention for an hour or so, goodness knows how they cope when it's busy.  For some reason my room key kept deactivating and I had to get it reset in reception every day, even though it…",4
"Plus points are the views, outdoor pool, peacefulness, rooms.  Negative points. Poorly designed lobby and restaurant. No bar. No indoor pool. Staff are not trained to European 5 star standard. Breakfast expensive. Location is isolated. Wifi not working in rooms. Lifts are poor.  Good value but never in a million years is this a 5 star hotel, how they have given this rating is beyond me.",3
"I booked a room in this Hotel to celebrate my 1st marriage anniversary, the Hotel in general is excellent with a wonderful view in front of the sea. The Hotel Crew accepted to change my room to an other which has both beach & swimming pool view with a big smile they are very kind and willing to help. The room was spacious clean and in order even small details. The breakfast was various, plenty of choices and you can have it in the large terrace of the Hotel moreover there is free parking for cars.....i really enjoyed my stay there.",5
"Very agreable place with luxury rooms. Huge, terrasse on the sea at a real interesting price. Typical with a very pleasant staff , speaking French. Breakfast offers delicious fresh fruits ,  orange juice and local food.",5
"Stayed here for my wedding night , we got upgraded to junior suit with amazing sea views and found the room decorated with petals and all extra bits to make it extra special at no added charge, hotel very clean and reception staff very friendly  Very good value for money compared with other hotels in the area , will be back for longer stay in the summer",5
"there's no towels in the rooms , and you keep asking for it all day . bad service.rooms are not clean .thequlity offood is not good enough.the good thing about the hotel is the view on the beach, but it' so far away from the center and you need to have a car , even for taxis it's difficult to find it because the hotel is new",1
"The hotel is new and is busy acquiring routine. Location is in a quiet part of Tanger, immediately at the seaside/beach. However guests cannot open gate to beach with room key. Maybe safety issue. Never have seen guests go out via swimming pool to beach area. Access to outside swimming pool is via long stairs. Access should be made available via elevator for elderly and handicapped people. Hotel is about one taxi euro away from city center. Rooms are good. Flatscreen tv with granted red-white-yellow connectivity, good! Channels mainly Arabic and French. Some movie channels in English with subs. We had no problem with changing our street view room with a sea side room. Balcony is small but cosy. Be careful with the draft, Tanger is sometimes windy. Room service is good, but…",4
"Stayed for 7 nights end of May 2013.   - # same breakfast every day # rooms in need of slight decoration # cleaning spends more time on making funny towel sculptures, rather than cleaning the room throughout # completely alcohol free hotel  + # big, spacious rooms # English speaking staff # good value for money  Overall very satisfied.  Rooms are very spacious and modern, but there are places that are in a need of some decoration.   Fantastic sea view from the balcony, if the skies are clear you can see Spain.   Good, quiet location. Good to have a car, but taxi (green one) costs about EUR 2.00 to the city center.   Hope this helps to make your minds up.  Good luck!",4
