"We had to book last minute since our Riad had a plumbing issue. We stayed in this beautiful property and although a complete change of plan, honestly it was a true treat. The restaurants were excellent, the breakfast specially. The service top notch. The room super spacious, stunning lightning options, beautiful washrooms. Highly recommend this place.",5
"Stayed last few days of May, as Morocco was coming out of many of the restrictions in place.  With tourism opening up, this was our first hotel on our trip, and as Diamond members we were welcomed as expected.  Executive lounge was closed, but we were given vouchers for the Kasbar lounge instead, and the bartender took care of us, during the evening social times and made it extremely pleasant as we wound down from our daytime touring.  I felt like we may have been the only Diamond members staying but that is to be expected with tourism so far down.  Our morning breakfast was inviting each day, and the staff was always available to help.  Front desk, and every staff member generally seemed happy and ready to help us although our needs were pretty low.  Location was great and plenty of places to enjoy the evening and eat dinner in the areas.  I highly recommend this location.‚Ä¶",5
"Really good hotel. Great check in , great breakfast, great dining and great bar. Overall very nice people working here. The staff was really good. We specially impressed by the concierge service who took special care to make our stay comfortable.",5
"The service here is outstanding. We checked in early in the morning. Our room was not ready, but the staff at the front desk invited us to have a snack at the executive lounge. As our room still was not ready, they were kind enough to upgrade us to a junior suite. The room was excellent. The hotel has an outdoor pool on the 13th floor. There is a very nice restaurant and bar/lounge on the top floor. An extensive breakfast was included. The restaurant staff at breakfast were absolutely outstanding. I would give the whole staff six stars if it was possible. The location adjoins a shopping center and it is convenient to everything in town ",5
Excellent hotel right next to train station Staff friendly knowledgeable  Staff immediately solve problems when asked Noise level next door neighbor TV too loud Manager immediately ask him to turn down tv and call back to confirm TV volume down üëç Will stay again,5
"Series of reviews here folks and this is very serious . I‚Äôve never been disappointed in all of my Hilton stays until now.  1) Room. Safety deposit box inside the room wasn‚Äôt working and we had to call it in 5 times and had to call the manager to get it fixed . Finally someone came after 9 hours. 2) Food service, handling and quality.  Staff were setting up the food ( including dried fruits and pastries) in their bare hands and not with gloves !  This is outright not acceptable! This is where you get sick !!! 3) unprofessionalism. The staff was taking photos in their Halloween costume with the food , with her back (long hair) hanging around the food and she‚Äôs flipping her long hair around the food!!!   I am writing this with a lot of exclamation marks as you can tell how outraged I am .  Calling Hilton management and ownership here !  Please do something about this .‚Ä¶",1
"The breakfast experience was not pleasant. Breakfast service started at 6am and we were first ones there at about 6:15am. It was understandable that they were still setting up. However, when I went to the egg station and asked for scrambled eggs, the young lady in hijab (sorry, I didn't get her name) responded that she's only serving over easy eggs. I informed her that I don't like the yolks wet and she begrudgingly said she would break the yolk of the over easy eggs she was already making. Not the best attitude or no sense of customer service. Someone else took over and started taking special requests like omelets. We then saw the same young lady in hijab picked up a loaf of the bread already displayed with her bare hands (no gloves) to be sliced. Aren't food handlers supposed to wear gloves when touching food? ‚Ä¶",5
This is a great hotel and a step up from other ones we have stayed in Morocco. The rooms were large and very well equipped and the staff very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was well organised and food was good.,5
"I can‚Äôt express how amazing oir stay was!! Thank you for Elhoussaine (he is a star) for the amazing check in experience. From the lounge to the concierge desk Mustafa took amazing care for us!  In the executive lounge we had Omar who always helped us!   The bar staff was fabulous too at the rooftop pool!  Abdelhamid was absolutely amazing Also big thanks to the rest of the bar, Hamza , Ayoub, Nordin  and youssef alami.   Two fantastic housekeepers kept our room spotless every day, Fatima and Saida! Thank you!  Also thanks for the rest of the staff who we interacted Mohhamed bernannou, Houda and Sara! You were amazing!  Please be very proud of them they truly represent high quality hospitality and the Hilton brand!",5
"Hilton - horrible experience - they need to focus on the client  We have very few interactions with hotel staff and when they are less than satisfactory, you are left with a bad taste in your mouth. That‚Äôs what happened to us at the Hilton. We were there with a tour group from Gate1. I realize there are labor shortages and some only apply because we were a large group, but trust me; these examples below show a lack of focus on client satisfactory. Do yourself a favor and just go somewhere else. Here is the recap of our issues, highs and lows: - breakfast service was spotty, no one came for coffee or offered eggs on our first morning. We found out that it was an option after seeing other patrons. We ordered them on the second day, it turns out there is a counter (egg station). But don‚Äôt order poached eggs, they are cooked in the back and after 20 minutes, I had to go back to remind the chef as she had totally forgot them.  - Our cards didn‚Äôt work after having waited 20 minutes to get them (even though our tour manager sent them all the info ahead of time). They had plenty of time (hours really) to create cards for 15 couples/rooms, but they started doing them when we arrived. But just our luck, ours we‚Äôre not coded, so we couldn‚Äôt get to our floor from the elevator. No problem, right; we went to the 6th floor and we‚Äôll just take the stairs down one floor. Guess what, all of the floors are locked but there are no cars readers to reenter (would think this would be a fire hazard!).  So we go to the lo by to go to the lobby ‚Ä¶.. explain, get our cards recoded. So we‚Äôre good, right? - We were ever told about the WIFi password for the hotel vs using the room#/lastname combo - Tried to call guest services (?) to figure out what went wrong and the phone rang and rang (at least 80 times) hung up and went to the reception a second time instead; they gave us the as we  - The hotel desk also does not provide change for local currency (was no issue at the Sofitel in Rabat where we stayed the previous two nights) - On the second day, both our cards stopped working (found out when we tried to go to the elevator - here we go again) - On the positive side, the the kasbar staff was helpful and has a decent selection  - The maid did a great job on our room, lots of little touches that make you feel special (left her a good tip) - The room is big, tv is recent, the bathroom is perfect, large shower and also a separate good size bath (which we never tried), comfy bed.‚Ä¶",2
"Tangier was our last stop in Morocco during our visit and it ended with a very sweet memory of Morocco. Mohammed the manager made our trip very rewarding. He was extremely accommodating and helpful by upgrading our room. If I ever go back to Tangier, I would definitely come back here. The location is perfect. It‚Äôs close to the beach and next to many great restaurants. If I can give 6 stars, this will be the place to do it. Thank you to everyone at the Hilton in City Center of Tangier. ",5
"This is a true definition of 5* hotel, from location, to quality, but the best part of it is the staff and their friendliness. Always willing to help and go above and beyond. We highly recommend this location",5
Hilton Tangier City Center Hotel and Residences is a fabulous hotel. It was very well appointed. The room was large and clean and very well decorated. Breakfast was very good and had everything an international could want. The staff was attentive and helpful. We would highly recommend this beautiful hotel.,5
"After the 2 years of pandemic its fantastic to get back to some of Hilton's top hotels , hotel Hilton Tanger city being one of them ;-)  , Their  superb service is still as high as ever,  this is a MUST STAY AT location ,  the food , pool , location and staff are excellent.  Their trainee guest manager Hajar was as professional as if she had 10 years experience.  She is a credit to the Hilton Hotel group.",5
"Centrally located hotel , clean and spacious rooms , very friendly staff, located near the promenade, nice stroll at night. The hotel has a very nice roof bar . We enjoyed the view , I would use the hotel when ever the occasion arises. The price is very reasonable.",4
"Very nice hotel with good facilities. The staff were very nice. I‚Äôm writing this review for the exceptional service I received from a lady called Hajar who worked in the breakfast area. She was apparently a trainee which shocked me, she had a super Attitude and was more than helpful in placing my order and liaising with me throughout my stay. I ordered VIP catering from hotel to take away. Everything went very smooth all thanks to her help. Also a big thank you to the chefs who were very accommodating. The Hilton should remove this trainee Badge as Hajar in my professional opinion staying in hotels roughly 190 nights a year and being Hilton diamond member for life is very far from a trainee. She is a professional with a super work ethic and her English was the best I came across‚Ä¶",5
"I am really enjoying staying at this hotel. All personnel is very kind, helpful and very dedicated. I am really feeling like staying at home. Room are spacious and have all necessary accessories with big and cozy bed. Food is delicious and really in the high standards. Special thanks to hotel staff lady Malak and lovely cleaning ladies Sabah and Somiya for your dedication and amazing job you doing. I would like to also give big thumbs up to Mustafa for his dedication and helpfulness in every occasion and all the personnel making this hotel truly 5* and beyond.  I will definitely recommend Hotel Hilton Tangier City Center for everyone want to visit or stay in Tangier.",5
"I stayed with my husband and 5 children. Check in check out process was very smooth! Hotel staffs were amazing, very friendly and helpful! We felt very welcomed! Room and breakfast were amazing! Location is excellent! Very recommended!",5
"The staff was very conscientious about cleanliness and safety during the pandemic, and maintained a warm professionalism that felt welcoming and helpful as well as making me feel safe during my recent travels. I hope to return and stay in the future!",4
I literally feel like home as i visit the hotel frequently .The service fits perfectly with a 5 * hotel. Breakfast time is great due to the kind service of all the staff (special thanks to Ilham & meriem). Great housekeeping service quality without forgetting Ms fatimazohra Elmhouar and its reactivity availability and kindeness. Big thanks to all the hilton tangier city center team that i didn't mentioned by name but do a wonderful job. Just keep doing things as you do.,5
"Hilton Tanger City Center is the best place to stay in Tanger, which is the most beautiful city in Morocco. The ladies on reception could be more smiley and welcoming, their attitude and customer service was quite cold and unwelcoming. The service at breakfast, including the lady who cooks omelettes, was very good and welcoming. The breakfast selection is really good with amazing views from the top floor. The best part is the housekeeping team. I would like to give special recognition to Fatna, who serviced the room to a 100% standard, she is very capable and does amazing work, leaving beautiful notes and beautiful and cute touches throughout the room like folding pyjamas etc. Fatna is a real credit to the team so thank you Fatna again",5
"The review concerns only a 1 night stay. Basically a very good hotel compared to what I already experienced in tanger. Very clean and confortable, staff very nice and professional. Although I don't know why but this hotel misses something to be perfect... It's not what I was expecting from a 5* hotel.  The restaurant has good food although the menu is very short and doesn't offer many options, I would say it's pretty basic and very expensive for what it is. Sure the place offers a great view, but lacks atmosphere. Breakfast is served in the same place. Buffet is well garnished, offers many varieties of tastes and flavours with good quality products.   I would definitely recommend this hotel. But next time I'll try the garden Inn that looks to be offering better view on the‚Ä¶",4
"Horrible stay.   Water extra cost even though your exec, Pets in pools ok but no outside food items if your a tourist.    Read past reviews prior to covid. I have now asked to speak to the manager 3 times and no one shows up. I want an explanation and a refund on my drinks that they forced us to throw out and buy.  Pets in pool ok and locals having food in the pool area is ok but outside coffee sitting in lobby is not ok.   Stayed at the sister hotel next door. Save your money and go there. Beds are the same and rooms are the same. Service both equal. Actually the sister Hilton property provided better service.",1
"Hotel is in a good location right next to the train station and mall.  Rooms are nice, clean and comfortable.  However, god forbid you bring Starbucks into the hotel but locals can have feasts upstairs on the pool deck from nearby restaurants. Asked to speak to a manager and still waiting an hour later.   Also, they do not enforce mask rules. During breakfast people had masks off and grabbing food and kids coughing around the buffet area without masks. Opt out of food here. Don‚Äôt want to catch anything or having screaming kids running around all breakfast.   Executive lounge is closed and force you to pay for water. Kinda messed up for Plat or Gold members.  Can‚Äôt believe I paid for water here while locals were charged free from big bottles they pour.   Everything else was fine‚Ä¶",1
"Stayed here for 40 days and experienced world class hospitality. Right from the guy who parked my car upto the GM Mr.Raouf made us feel welcome. Some special people to mention.  Mr Fateh the executive chef  never made us miss  home food and went the extra mile.  Mr Jaouad, miss Safae and all the beautiful front office staff  never made us feel out of place   Mr Yahyah Mr Mahedi, me Zakaria, Mr Hamza, Mr Hamid, miss Khoutar all a pleasure and always smiling and serving   And how can we miss house keeping with Miss Houda Moussa Fatima Zahara and can‚Äôt remember the other but made the rooms up so we never missed home.  God. Bless you and and you all are stars. Thanks for making our long stay memeorable even though we were at work.",5
Another Hilton that is in track of Hilton standards! We stayed for three nights. The hotel is perfectly located close to everything. The staff were nice and welcoming especially Zineb at Kasbah restaurant who was alway above and beyond. I would definitely recommend.,5
Id love to thank you guys for this beautiful hotel - i had a great staycation !  The hotel is very good and the location also. The stuff is very nice and the room are very clean  Literally its one of my favorite places where i can spend the weekend with the family,5
If your are looking for the best room in tanger city you must try this hotel with the best concierge service ever.   special thanks to Mustafa from the hotel concierge. Amazing experience thank you Hilton. ,5
"I literally feel like home the service fits perfectly with a 5 * hotel. Breakfast buffet is was great. Everything is freshly made. Great service at the check in, beautiful property! Amazing staff Especially NACER housekeeping, I was amazed by the surprise he made for us with the special decoration and the note on the bed that I kept with me as a souvenir.  Good luck  See you at Marriott  Fez ! :)",5
I was here for a training event and thought the hotel was great. - staff just superb especially in the restaurant  - gym was well laid out and well maintained - well appointed rooms - excellent food - safety precautions for COVID were very good   We were holding a training event at the hotel and the conference staff and manager could not have been more helpful.  My only negative is the overly inflated alcohol prices but that was merely a niggle. Great place to stay in Tangier and those views across to Spain are super,5
My group stayed in two twin guest rooms at this Hilton Feb 25-27 during our trip to Morocco. Some of the reviews I read on TA had me a bit nervous about the stay but due to its location (walking distance from the train station) we booked anyway and hoped for the best. Our stay surpassed our expectations by far and we had a wonderful time.  Room & Food: The twin guest rooms have full size beds (larger than a twin but smaller than queen) that were very comfortable. The room was a great size for two with large luggage. Three can fit in the room but it might be a little tight with limited walking space. The bathroom is large and contained a full size tub. We also ordered room service which was reasonably priced and delivered quickly. Breakfast is available each morning on an upper‚Ä¶,5
"Upon checking into his hotel, I was VERY impressed for what I paid for this comparing US dollars. This hotel looked very new and was a 5 star hotel. The staff was very friendly upon check in, and on our way to our room, we were impressed with our pristine the lobbies were, the wonderful scent, decor, and when we walked into our room, we were very impressed. The nice ocean view room, floor to ceiling tile in the bathroom, the snacks waiting for us with custom note.   We stayed there right before the Coronavirus pandemic hit the second week of March.   If you're interested in taking a day trip to Chefchaouen, I would HIGHLY recommend it. The hotel arranged for a driver at the cost of 1,100 MAD, or about $110 USD which was well worth it considering it took 2.5 hours each way. Once‚Ä¶",5
"Stayed for 7 nights Diamond member, had to wait for rooms, 4 glasses of wine worked out ¬£10 a glass, nothing special local Moroccan wine, lovely room mini suite, staff very friendly, BUT the executive lounge was not up to Hilton standards, food very poor, and they only allocated 1 bottle of gin and 3 x 500 size bottles of rose and red per evening ( other drinks available on same scale, so they ran out at 7.30pm and would not replenish...SHAME... breakfast good range of good, helpful staff, room lovely...",3
State of the art Hotel with top facilities and highly skilled and trained personnel. I highly recommend staying in this property whether for family or business trip (I stayed there 6 months ago for business meetings).  A special thanks for Safae at the Guest relationship desk who took care of us as we were staying at home!,5
"We stayed here last week and I have to say it is possibly the worst ever Hilton I have ever stayed at in my entire life, definitely¬†nowhere near a 5 star hotel.¬† Me and my boyfriend made a 6 night booking to celebrate my birthday which was on the 12th February.¬† Upon making the reservation, I stated that I would¬†like a non-smoking room.

"It's an upscale Hilton with all the usual amenities -- a small step up from the Hilton Garden Inn that is easily confused with it, located at the other end of the block.  What really impressed us about this hotel was the friendliness and kindness of the staff.  And I mean ALL the staff, from the front desk, to the women who cleaned our room, and especially to the staff of the top-floor Casbah Restaurant.  My wife and I were traveling along with our daughter and 3-year old granddaughter.   Over the three nights we were there, the hotel staff extended one kindness after another to our granddaughter who at age 3 can be rambunctious.  We chose this hotel for its location, but will come back for the genuine warmth its staff showed.",5
Large modern rooms. The executive rooms get you access to the longe with cocktails and snacks. Also you get breakfast which is very good. This is one of the nicest Hilton‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed in.  Also the location is great. ,5
Very Nice stay at hilton. Very professional staff and the service was excellent. I advise to everyone to go there and enjoy the hotel which is by the way very near from the train station and from the beach,5

"I travel the world every year, experiencing around 150 nights a year in hotels like this, but this was so far the worse during 2019, the second worse was Hilton S√£o Paulo I was there for NYE with 3 other friends, since the arrival they couldn‚Äôt find my friends reservations, mine was fine The second day I asked for the free water they are supposed to offer in the rooms, their plain answer was: they don‚Äôt, only day for day 1, even thought I complained, I got nothing The day after was NYE so we went to the hotel party, what a bad service, terrible food, totally bad When I woke up, i wanted water, o assumed minibar had some, to my surprise it was empty, what kind of a hotel denies water to guests?

"We stayed here 2 nights and 3 days before continuing our road trip adventure across the Andalusia.  I must say it‚Äôs a true executive hotel. That luxury experience you need after roughing it across the Sahara. We were greeted well.   Samhra and Imad were both very good help! The lounge for executive status is nice and has all the amenities you need. The breakfast restaurant is great and service is very prompt, professional and very pleasant.   I must say of all the Hilton‚Äôs I‚Äôve had the good fortune to stay at across the world this one has the biggest heart.

At dinner, my wife wasn‚Äôt feeling to well so the team actually made a special tea for her. At breakfast, Ilham made sure we tried some local delicacies as well.    While we were checking out, my son was feeling sick and Mustafa (Concierge) was super helpful taking him to the toilet and getting him something to calm his system.   What was even more spectacular, was that no one was willing to take a tip   Outstanding team. Bravo to everyone who gave us an experience to savour.   Thanks  ",5
"This 5 star hotel is located at city center, Rooms are spacious as well as bathroom and bed is comfortable and breakfast is delicious with international food and staff are so polite and helpful, this hotel is opposite the main train station and if you arrived by train no need to take a taxi because the hotel is just a few yards away",4

When looking for places to stay in Tangier, I knew that there was only one choice for my stay: Hilton Tangier City Center Hotel and Residences.

Nice and large rooms Very clean rooms  Excellent breakfast  Nice pool but not not heated: a bad surprise! Good gym facilities: well equipped Professional staff eager to make customers satisfied  Not centrally located but taxi are inexpensive and bullet train station is 200 meter from the hotel!,4
"The hotel's location is excellent, being close to the corniche and easy to find.  Mall next door is generic and of no interest.  Old city is a long (30-40 minutes) but pleasant walk.  The facility itself is new and high end but service could use some tweaking.  Check in was efficient but not overly helpful.  No luggage assistance offered though we don't mind taking our own.  Diamond status was recognized and a minor room upgrade and welcome amenity of fruit and cookies provided.  Room was nice, though as others have noted the windows are filthy and need to be cleaned to enjoy the view.

I am not sure if it is appropriate to mention her by name, but it is spelled H****. She was very sweet, made us feel at home and was very kind. Management should be able to identify her and personally give her praise. We arrived on Oct 8 and can provide more details, if necessary.",5
Sadly we had only one night stay here. The location was prime with a short walk to the beautiful beach & activities in one direction & in the other a shopping mall. Views from our room were or the beach & coastline. Breakfast was so good we took our time and it was a feature of the morning. Special mention of the porridge made with yogurt.,5
The hotel is direct on the front of main train station in Tanger. You do not need any taxi.  The service was very good. All hotel stuff were very helpfull.

"I stayed one night and found the hotel unimpressive.  The reception downstairs was uninterested in new visitors and were busy having a conversation.  I made my way to the executive floor where I checkin.  The room was ok size- not big but not tinny, clean and comfortable. CNN is the only English TV station I could find.  I asked for 3 wake up calls on 2 different occasions and I‚Äôm still waiting ( thank god for backup plans). The happy hour at the lounge had no vegetarian option... not even one... The room service has no vegetarian options too but they made up a pasta with tomato, as per my request.  The person at the room service line did not speak English so I had to find a translator. Breakfast on the 15th floor had a great view but the good is not impressive.",2
"Lovely hotel but here for two nights, last night this evening, my air conditioner does not work. Will not cool.  Someone came and ‚Äòfixed it‚Äô but now back in room and not cool. Have rang three or four times to guest services with no answer.  Not what you expect from Hilton. ",4
The hotel is very good   . The service is slow for any request.  They do not have welcoming behavior  for the customer. The room is very good  however they do not provide dental kit  or shaving kit without request. Finally I would like to appreciate Mrs  Ayah in housekeeping for her  good job  and organization  Hilton group is considered one   Of excellent  hotels in  many countries,4
"We stayed here only one night in tangier. An overnight trip from tafira in spain. This was our third visit to tangier but the last one was 30 years ago. A lot has changed, still very cosmopolitan but now more modern and a little more orientated toward tourism. Our first visit was a bit of an ordeal really but this time we enjoyed everything from the tour around the kasbah and medina to the food in the city. Most of all we enjoyed the Hilton. Close enough to the city but far enough to escape the bustle of the traffic. Beautifully constructed and the staff (without exception) happy, cheerful and helpful.

My brilliant visit to marvelous city Tangier. It is a brilliant hotel that I can recommend for every body. The location of this hotel is excellent. The staff is friendly. The hotel is very clean. The breakfast is excellent  ,5
"Stayed there on a business trip to Tangier. The place, the staff is great. Rooms are modern, quiet and very comfortable - the higher the better. :). The only caveat is breakfast where I have, twice, the bad surprise of not finding what I wanted. Replenishing was not managed properly, and there were lots of things missing. Not a big deal though, but it would have gotten 5 stars otherwise.",4
"I just loved my visit here. Mustafa, the concierge, was incredibly resourceful and made me laugh a lot. The views were astounding, and I loved practicing my Arabic with some kids in the lobby who responded to my Arabic with perfect English. Tangier is a beautiful city, and spending the day at this beautiful hotel in the company of Mustafa and other wonderful staff members made the 12 hour train trip from Tangier to Marrakech extremely tolerable. I freshened up at the remarkable hotel just before alighting the midnight train making my overnight travel restful and easy. Thanks again Mustafa!!!",5
"Where to begin? This was an amazing trip, never have been in Morroco before and thanks to the Hotel it highlighted the beauty of Tangier and the trip even more so. From the first moment of arriving it went swiftly and flawlessly. Would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff who work there who all helped in creating a wonderful experience especially (younes, yasine, doha and imad!!). If you have a chance do book the King Junior Suite! The room is perfect, as well as the executive rooms. Also worth mentioning, housekeeping who have done a great job in tidying the room spotless clean, as well as the breakfast team for providing such an amazing breakfast at the 15th floor with a magnificent view to the sea. Anyway this review is already way too long and some readers will‚Ä¶",5
"Excellent service, friendly staff and great location... was a pleasure to stay there and experience Morocco in a comfortable setting with excellent air conditioning and friendly and competent staff. Would stay again.",5
Shower booth door is broken and led to water leakage. Other than that everything was very good and up to standard. Pool is excellent and very timely check in and out. Excellent services by the staff. Free parking as well.,4
"Fabulous stay  I was extremely happy with my stay, the food was fabulous, the service exceptional, the beds comfy and the facilities more than adequate. All the staff I spoke with were helpful, friendly and very professional. A most comfortable stay!  I would like to to thank Fatima zahra for her great service,Amin really he is a lovey man ,Hafsa at the breakfast area were very helpful.thanks to Mohammed at the front desk. The housekeeper were excellent (sorry I forgot her name ) Thanks everyone .",5
The Las Kasbah restaurant was an amazing Chicken and Lemon Tangine.  Badr was an amazing waiter and took care of everything from the wine selection to the tangine! The overall experience was amazing from booking local visits as well as the hotel amenities including a great rooftop bar and pool. I would highly recommend this location and hotel for any tourists looking for an exceptional quality of service away from home.  Breakfast is also delicious so I recommend having that every day!,5
"I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough. It‚Äôs a beautiful place situated in ideal location. The staff is really amazing and the Concierge is really helpful. I forgot my bag and he made every effort possible to get it back to me on time. The rooms are lovely, spacious and comfortable. Bathrooms are modern and spacious and the lobby and other areas are really beautiful. The roof top restaurants is spectacular and the breakfast is really amazing. Everything is 5 star. ",5
" Very simple words This hotel is perfect for :  family ,business location centre service great  values   Big room is very clean ,  Close to the airport 20 minutes very nicely. cool view from the breakfast 15th floor ",5
"Excellent rooms, well appointed ans a lovely rooftop pool and restaurant.   Superb breakfast at the restaurant upstairs, really incredible   The staff is superb and the manager Samr made all the difference.  She took care of our issues, and exceed our expectations in every way. Samr you are 10/10, best manager I have encountered in 23 years of weekly business travel around the world.   Well done and thank you again !",5
"We sadly booked by mistake - (and which is beyond terrible) - the Hilton Garden Inn which is the sister hotel and right next door to) the Hilton Tanger City Centre Hotel & residences.  We had a truly terrible time in our hotel as the service was beyond disgusting and we were upset, so we went into the Hilton Tanger City Centre knowing that we would be getting a superior service.  We were not wrong.  We met by chance the Restuarant Manager - Saad Chhiyar as we were looking to have dinner in the hotel.  He was beyond wonderful and helpful.  He, along with Badr - our absolutely delightful waiter went above and beyond to look after us and absolutely treated us like royalty.  We had a wonderful evening with fantastic service and food that was absolutely delicious - I had the warm‚Ä¶",5
"We had a great stay at the Hilton. The hotels facilities and rooms are all beautiful and the two rooftop terraces and bar and stunning. Special mention in particular to Omar at the Kasbah who is one of the most welcoming, attentive and friendly people we met in Tanger and across Hilton stays! Not forgetting Imad, Sara and Nada who met all our questions with a smile and were great to see going in and out!  Thank you - Gareth & Bea",5
"Had a very distasteful check in experience where my wife when asking the security guard where the entrance to check in. He rudely suggested we are at the wrong Hilton as this is ""5 star"" and to go to the garden in pointing the direction to walk in.   Despite this disrespectful and distasteful experience. Me and my family got to enjoy the friendly staff and service at breakfast and the pool. My advice is if you have a family expect the pool to have limited space to sit down on the sun beds or even a chair but only at peak times. Location of this hotel is perfect and the staff are really happy and have a great grasp of English.",4
Good overall HOTEL service with nice quite and clean rooms. Fine restaurant with sufficient choice. Breakfast is excellent with fresh products and lot's of choice. The staff is very helpful and friendly.,5
I love to stay agin in the hotel and l i will soon. And thanks for every member who work in the hotel to make as happy and fell relax and safe withe you i wish you all the beat and i wish i can make a one day to dinner withe the whole workers.,5
Much to be upgraded here. Firstly the carpets in the foyer have a damp smell making the whole area smell bad. No tissue boxes in the rooms and a small variety of cosmetics. The lounge had only buts and desserts to snack on. The evening light snacks were very limited as well. Breakfast was 5 star. Pool area was lovely but very cold due to it being on the 15th floor.,3
"PROS: Location [at one end of the waterfront walk] The Hotel is fresh, modern and comfortable. Transportation options are just outside, a Shopping Mall is attached. The Beach is a couple of blocks away. Breakfast is Excellent [including fresh brewed Mint Tea]! In the Breakfast Lounge Khalid [Asst. Mgr.] was exceptionally attentive to our needs. A special 'send-off' was unexpected but encapsulated the fun/enjoyable time at the hotel!  CONS: n/a  SUGGESTIONS: n/a",5
"If your on the Costa Del Sol ( Spain ) or want somthing new ,  the trip to Tangers and a stay at the Hilton Tanger City Center Hotel is a MUST. Using this hotel as a base to the city of Tangers is easy to navigate into the old town or beach front. It is minutes from the ferry terminal by taxi.  The Hotel itself is amazing, great rooms, super pool & chill area on the 13th floor and the breakfast on the 15th floor is amazing , of course thanks to Khalid and his staff who has many years experience in WW 5 star hotels , he is a super professional.  The exec lounge is well stocked for a quite  drink before heading out to dinner.  In summary , go to Tangers , stay at the Hilton Tanger City Center hotel for a 100% amazing experience not to mention the value !.  From a HH Diamond member.",5
"I need to start by saying that this Hilton Resort truly deserves 10 Stars and the reasons for that are endless!  Me and my husband stayed there last month for 4 great nights! The service from Front Desk, Housekeeping, Food & Beverage (Breakfast) Hosts, to Clerks is beyond amazing! Everybody was trained really well and knew what they were doing.   Ibtissam, was the front desk agent who checked us in, very courteous, helpful and professional. She got us a nice room with a city view. Great amenities! We had breakfast all 4 mornings at the beautiful La Terrace restaurant with spectacular sea views: All hosts provided us with amazing service all throughout our stay:  Meryem is a gem, amazing big smile and she would go above and beyond to get us what we would fancy, especially with my‚Ä¶",5
"This hotel exceeded my expectations by all means! The location, service, dining, and rooms are quality and truly worth it if you are staying in Tanger. I would be happy to return again! The breakfast buffet and views to the ocean were some of the highlights of my stay! Overall, PHENOMENAL experience! ",5
"Hilton Tanger City is a wonderful, well-appointed facility, beautiful, adjacent to a large shopping mall and a large public transportation hub. About 30 minutes walk to the old Medina, but only one block to a pretty, large public beach.",5
"I have to begin with a disclosure: I am a lifetime Platinum Marriott rewards member with current Titanium status. I don‚Äôt stay at Hiltons unless there IS no Marriott in town, as was the case here. Having said that, I was impressed with most of what the Hilton Tangier City Center Hotel & Residences had to offer during my stay. I also had my status matched to Hilton Diamond, so I was given a club floor room and don‚Äôt know if that had an impact on the stay or not.  The good: staff service was excellent in room service (Kawtor was the sweetest room attendant, who not only serviced the room but provided extra touches like rose petals on the bed, a daily note, and a nice curtain display), and the front desk and concierge employees spent extra effort in tracking down a lost suitcase‚Ä¶",4
"Well, we screwed up - twice and book either the wrong Hilton or on a wrong night.  However,  no need to worry.  The front desk manager and other staff are amazing.  They quickly swooped in both times and did everything they could help.  Incredible service.  Also, the hotel is incredibly clean, modern, and has stunning views. Stay here!!!",5
I'll start with the pro's  The housekeeping was amazing! Truly 5 star hotel quality.  The beds were comfortable and the room was a decent size.  The room Service staff were polite both taking the orders and delivery. The food was good 1 time and terrible the next.  The conceirge guys were all really polite and efficient.  Cons There was no turn down service.  Even though I called and asked on the 1st day they said yes of course there is about 10 mins later a guy showed up at the door with 2 towels.  We were tired from an entire day out and couldn't be bothered insisting. We never got a turn down service in the 5 days. We constantly had to keep asking for clean towels. As we like to shower in the morning and evening. In a hot country I dont think its extraordinary! One evening we‚Ä¶,3
"Great location, close to the beach and shopping mall. Rooms are perfect (clean, large, complimentary water bottles, kettle, tea/coffee) nice view of Tanja main train station. Staff are very professional and lovely especially the house keepers Fatima zahra and Sukaina. Whenever I go back to my room at the end of the day, I find a towel with beautiful decorative shape on the bed and bathroom.  Not too expensive for Hilton.  The only downside is that they don‚Äôt have spa.  The restaurant in the 15th floor is very delicious with convenient prices.",5
"Took my second trip this year to Tangier, and stayed again at the Hilton Tanger Hotel.  Exec floor is superb.  EVERY single employee makes you feel special.  Breakfast is outstanding -- both the food, and the view from the restaurant overlooking that incredible corniche of the bay.  Two employees were especially noteworthy: Jamal in F&B is attentive, friendly, eager to please, and seems always to have a smile on his face.  In all the Hilton properties I've visited, he is one of the finest employees I've met, always seeking to help you feel welcome with a little extra energy.  And Mustafa at the front desk was a font of information.  His quick action when an unexpected 'oops, I drank the water' reaction occurred helped my last two days at the hotel be bearable.  Who knew that‚Ä¶",5
"If you‚Äôre hesitating between this and another hotel, I do not recommend this one. We chose this hotel based on the great reviews, and the amenities offered. we wish we had gone with our initial choice. The hot tub was not hot, it was barely warm. After a full day of walking around, I was really looking forward to the hot tub, so this was very disappointing. The sauna and steam room were also not hot.   When we returned to the room after being out and about, it was so filled with cigarette smoke that we had to ask to be moved to a different room!    On a positive note, the staff were friendly and helpful!",3
We had an amazing stay at the Hilton. The staff was extremely courteous. I must make a special mention about Mustafa from travel desk. He went out of the way to make our stay and travel arrangements very pleasant and took very good care of us. I rate the experience fantastic.,5
"the staff was the most friendly and welcoming i have ever seen in Morocco. from the cleaning ladies, front desk , pool and check in. the hotel is very big and well decorated. perfect for a short stay or even to go to the beach which is not far",5
"Place of peace, well located in the center of the city variety of entertainment choices, outings and excursions. Near the Mall and the Train station. Good value for money Staff is attentive and caring.",5
Amazing Hotel. Perfect location. Just in front of the train station. Shops around. Great staff. Spend one night there with 2 teenagers. Amazing view. Tangier is a beautiful city. Will definitely come back. ,5
