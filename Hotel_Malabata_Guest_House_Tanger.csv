"Malabata guest house is a great place to stay. The room and the terrace are very nice and big. The breakfast was delicious. Mohammed was very friendly and he showed me that he I there for everything I need, he was smiling all the time and answered me to all my questions about everything. He let me use his computer to make my check-in for the flight and print it out. The place is easy to be found and it's close to the beach.  I recommend Malabata Guest House to everyone and I would like to go there again.  Thank you very much Mohammed for your kindness.  Ioana",5
"A beautiful experience, wonderful place and a lovely service .  The host was there for us whenever we needed him, he offers rides when we wanted to go out to visit the city .... you can also see the beautiful paintings ...oh and there is a PIANO",4
"Stayed here for three nights while in Tangier. The home is quite nice with a number of separate suites, each with their own Wi-Fi and TV. They are very nicely appointed, and the room was quite large. I also had a balcony with a view of the garden of the property. There's parking for a small car or motorcycles which is secured. The breakfast here is very good! In particular, the crepes or pancakes are delicious. breakfast is served at 9 a.m. which is a little late if you plan to do some traveling. Otherwise, the lady that makes the crepes, is a great asset to the guest house, as these are the best crepes I have had in Morocco! The house is located about 10 minutes from downtown Tangier and the Medina. I would definitely come back here.  ",5
"We stayed in the Malabata Guest House somewhat longer than we planned. Although everything was very well arranged by the lovely owner Driss and his right-hand Hassan. Nothing was to much for them and they made it a trip we will never forget. If we want to eat outside the guest house, Hassan brought us, when we wanted to have a trip, Driss was always ready for us. A highly recommended place to be!!!",5
"The place is good from the inside but from the outside there is no beautiful view ( sea, nature..) it's more like a house than a touristic guest house . The food is alright but I've tasted better food in old Madina which is so far away from the guest house.. i'm sorry but i didn't enjoy it at all",1
"If you are visiting Tangier, do not stay at a hotel, typical tourist venue.  Malabata Guesthouse is an amazing experience.  You will feel at home in this gorgeous guesthouse depicting true Moroccan lifestyle, ambiance and unbelievable decor.  To top it off the owners:hosts treat you like royalty.  From greeting you, showing you around, giving you a lift and explaining all about the area.  In the morning they fixed us an amazing complimentary breakfast.  The host asked me if there was anything else I wanted to do before leaving Morocco. I said ""yes, I want to ride a camel"".  Well he made it happen.  I highly recommend this lovely place.  ",5
Our family stayed here for one night last week. It was amazing from start to finish with Driss and his wife looking after our every need in their traditional and beautiful Moroccan home. We wouldn't hesitate to stay again and would highly recommend to all visiting Tangier. ,5
"Absolutely astonishing service and hospitality from the proprietors of this beautiful traditional Moroccan Guest House. Nothing was too much, they do not indulge in alcohol but Driss himself took my niece & brother to buy wine for our traditional meal that they prepared for our family. Our every wish was catered for, they picked up snacks from the local cafe when we arrived, went out to get a breakfast spread they didn't have for my niece. Unbelievable service given with no hesitation and their only wish was we enjoyed our stay and food.",5
"Driss and his wife own a fantastically beautiful guest house. When i walked in i could not believe how stunningly decorated it is, a moroccan palace. Every single thing has had no expense spared and they are such generous and kind people. There is one review on here which mentioned dishonesty but that really is far from the truth. Driss and his lovely wife bent over backwards to help us. They drove us too the alcohol shop even though they do not drink themselves and offered to pay for our alcohol in dirhams because we only had euros and to pay him back at end of our stay if needed. They cooked us a tagine. They ordered and picked us up some food from a local cafe because we didn't know the area or language. Driss spent lots of time out of his busy life to talk to us about the culture in morocco. I have never had service like this before. This is also an example of the people of moroccos kind nature. Shukraan. …",5
"We arrived to this place, which looked amazing, like a palace. Mosaics everywhere, velvet upholstery, what a royal welcome to Morocco....or so we thought.   We were greeted by the owner Driss Semlali, who told us to put our bags down while he made us tea. He asked the taxi to wait.   Driss told us that there was a problem and that Expedia never confirmed the reservation with him, so he didn't have any rooms available, but he was working on a solution for us.   So,  While we were waiting, he told us all the wonderful things about his guest house that we wouldn't be taking advantage of since, as he claimed, expedia didn't confirm the reservation with him.   Shortly after, his phone rings, he has a brief conversation in Arabic. He then says to the person on the phone ""I'm going to talk in English so that everybody understands. I will pay you directly, so they are all set to stay there"" .....Yay We are going to a mystery hotel!  We get back in the taxi, without a say as to our new plans, in a foreign place, unable to communicate with our driver. The taxi drives us into Tanger, locks his doors at one point, rolls up the windows, as people are banging on the van. All we can think is ""where Is this guy taking us?""   We arrive at the hotel (thankfully) and it is not nearly as nice as what we had already paid for. We were not happy about this situation. The woman at the desk showed us a room with twin beds. We asked her what she normally charges for the room because we didn't think Driss was being completely honest with us.  She promptly offered to upgrade us no questions asked to a larger suite that was double the price on their website.   The owner of Malabata guest house Driss, said this was the second time that this had happened and he was very upset about the issue and would be calling expedia.  It is 2 weeks later and I just called expedia.  I was told there was no record of Malabata guest house every having contacted them. Suspicious? We'll let you be the judge.   As far as expedia knew, we had stayed there. I would exercise caution before booking this place. Confirm your reservation and contact the guest house before.…",1
"We were welcomed with  tea and morrocan sweets. Our room was very comfortable and amazingly decorated. We enjoyed the quiet and beautiful environment we had the chance to stay in. The manager helped us organizing our trips to Asilah and to Chefchaouen, it was very kind of him ! We also visited Hercules' caves and the beautiful kasbah of Tangier. We will definitely come again ! PS: If you have the chance to stop by, you HAVE to taste the delicious morrocan food they serve !!",4
"I am traveling through Spain and Morocco by bicycle and when I landed at tangier MED (the main port used now from Spain), I had a good 40k to bike to town. On the way, I did a quick search and saw this Riad on the outskirts of town, so I swung by.   Lucky for me the proprietor, Driss, opened the door and welcomed me into his Riad. What an experience! The home is beautiful and filled with handcrafted love. The food was amazing and plentiful and Driss went above and beyond what could be expected by helping me with personal details, offering me a lift into town, and being great company.   I couldn't recommend this house more, and if I had a family or group, I would happily take the whole place!",5
This is a memorable hotel with even more memorable hosts. Driss was very helpful and gave us rides in to the center and guided us to good restaurants. We stayed two couples just before new years. The walls are covered with mosaics from the family business in Fez. The details are so impressive. We were super satisfied with everything. Highly recommended. ,5
"We spent a delightful night at Riad Malabata in December 2015. The room was fantastic, the food was among the best we had in all of Morocco! The hosts were extremely friendly, accommodating and offered a lot of interesting information about their country. Our only regret was that we could not stay longer to enjoy more of the lovely accomodations and good fellowship.",5

We were greeted by the owner Driss Semlali, who told us to put our bags down while he made us tea. He asked the taxi to wait.   Driss told us that there was a problem and that Expedia never confirmed the reservation with him, so he didn't have any rooms available, but he was working on a solution for us.   So,  While we were waiting, he told us all the wonderful things about his guest house that we wouldn't be taking advantage of since, as he claimed, expedia didn't confirm the reservation with him.   Shortly after, his phone rings, he has a brief conversation in Arabic. He then says to the person on the phone ""I'm going to talk in English so that everybody understands. I will pay you directly, so they are all set to stay there"" .....Yay We are going to a mystery hotel!  We get back in the taxi, without a say as to our new plans, in a foreign place, unable to communicate with our driver. The taxi drives us into Tanger, locks his doors at one point, rolls up the windows, as people are banging on the van. All we can think is ""where Is this guy taking us?""   We arrive at the hotel (thankfully) and it is not nearly as nice as what we had already paid for. We were not happy about this situation. The woman at the desk showed us a room with twin beds. We asked her what she normally charges for the room because we didn't think Driss was being completely honest with us.  She promptly offered to upgrade us no questions asked to a larger suite that was double the price on their website.   The owner of Malabata guest house Driss, said this was the second time that this had happened and he was very upset about the issue and would be calling expedia.  It is 2 weeks later and I just called expedia.  I was told there was no record of Malabata guest house every having contacted them. Suspicious? We'll let you be the judge.   As far as expedia knew, we had stayed there. I would exercise caution before booking this place. Confirm your reservation and contact the guest house before.…",1
"Malabata guest house is a great place to stay. The room and the terrace are very nice and big. The breakfast was delicious. Mohammed was very friendly and he showed me that he I there for everything I need, he was smiling all the time and answered me to all my questions about everything. He let me use his computer to make my check-in for the flight and print it out. The place is easy to be found and it's close to the beach.  I recommend Malabata Guest House to everyone and I would like to go there again.  Thank you very much Mohammed for your kindness.  Ioana",5
"A beautiful experience, wonderful place and a lovely service .  The host was there for us whenever we needed him, he offers rides when we wanted to go out to visit the city .... you can also see the beautiful paintings ...oh and there is a PIANO",4
"Stayed here for three nights while in Tangier. The home is quite nice with a number of separate suites, each with their own Wi-Fi and TV. They are very nicely appointed, and the room was quite large. I also had a balcony with a view of the garden of the property. There's parking for a small car or motorcycles which is secured. The breakfast here is very good! In particular, the crepes or pancakes are delicious. breakfast is served at 9 a.m. which is a little late if you plan to do some traveling. Otherwise, the lady that makes the crepes, is a great asset to the guest house, as these are the best crepes I have had in Morocco! The house is located about 10 minutes from downtown Tangier and the Medina. I would definitely come back here.  ",5
"We stayed in the Malabata Guest House somewhat longer than we planned. Although everything was very well arranged by the lovely owner Driss and his right-hand Hassan. Nothing was to much for them and they made it a trip we will never forget. If we want to eat outside the guest house, Hassan brought us, when we wanted to have a trip, Driss was always ready for us. A highly recommended place to be!!!",5
"The place is good from the inside but from the outside there is no beautiful view ( sea, nature..) it's more like a house than a touristic guest house . The food is alright but I've tasted better food in old Madina which is so far away from the guest house.. i'm sorry but i didn't enjoy it at all",1
"If you are visiting Tangier, do not stay at a hotel, typical tourist venue.  Malabata Guesthouse is an amazing experience.  You will feel at home in this gorgeous guesthouse depicting true Moroccan lifestyle, ambiance and unbelievable decor.  To top it off the owners:hosts treat you like royalty.  From greeting you, showing you around, giving you a lift and explaining all about the area.  In the morning they fixed us an amazing complimentary breakfast.  The host asked me if there was anything else I wanted to do before leaving Morocco. I said ""yes, I want to ride a camel"".  Well he made it happen.  I highly recommend this lovely place.  ",5
Our family stayed here for one night last week. It was amazing from start to finish with Driss and his wife looking after our every need in their traditional and beautiful Moroccan home. We wouldn't hesitate to stay again and would highly recommend to all visiting Tangier. ,5
"Absolutely astonishing service and hospitality from the proprietors of this beautiful traditional Moroccan Guest House. Nothing was too much, they do not indulge in alcohol but Driss himself took my niece & brother to buy wine for our traditional meal that they prepared for our family. Our every wish was catered for, they picked up snacks from the local cafe when we arrived, went out to get a breakfast spread they didn't have for my niece. Unbelievable service given with no hesitation and their only wish was we enjoyed our stay and food.",5
"Driss and his wife own a fantastically beautiful guest house. When i walked in i could not believe how stunningly decorated it is, a moroccan palace. Every single thing has had no expense spared and they are such generous and kind people. There is one review on here which mentioned dishonesty but that really is far from the truth. Driss and his lovely wife bent over backwards to help us. They drove us too the alcohol shop even though they do not drink themselves and offered to pay for our alcohol in dirhams because we only had euros and to pay him back at end of our stay if needed. They cooked us a tagine. They ordered and picked us up some food from a local cafe because we didn't know the area or language. Driss spent lots of time out of his busy life to talk to us about the culture in morocco. I have never had service like this before. This is also an example of the people of moroccos kind nature.
