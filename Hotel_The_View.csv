"Great hotel in the heart of Rabat! the rooms are clean, the hallways smell exceptionally good! every single employee is detail oriented and cared about us. If you want to feel ""ROYAL"" then The View Hotel is the place to be! We also tried the famous restaurant located in the 15th floor that is called The Legend; WooW! The view is exceptional, food quality is amazing and the service is smooth and friendly! THANK YOU! We will be back to try the coffee shop located on the 14th floor.",5
"I'm tempted to rate this hotel as ""poor"" but that probably wouldn't be fair.  The room is clean and comfortable although lighting is terrible.  I guess ""soft lighting"" is in fashion.  If you are a woman who puts on make-up in the bathroom, good luck to you!  You get a make-up mirror but not enough lighting to see what you are doing.  My biggest problem was that I left sunglasses in the room when I left for a weekend tour.  I realized it quickly after leaving but I knew I would be back in a couple of days so asked our driving to call the hotel and ask them to retrieve the glasses from the room and hold them at the Reception Desk.  When I returned a few days later, they had no idea what I was talking about. No one seemed to be able to track the glasses.  I called the front desk repeatedly.  Finally, at 11 pm, someone showed up at the door with sunglasses.  They weren't mine.  I was told it would be solved in the morning but I had an early departure.  They did notify me that they found the glasses after I left the country and when I tried to contact them to ask them to send them by courier at my expense I got no answer.  I have a colleague in Rabat.  I felt badly asking him to help me solve this but I did, and he will get my glasses back to me.  The hassle was so unnecessary but it was typical of the lack of service at the hotel throughout.  Check-in was slow.  You hand over your passport, sit in the lobby and just wait for your room key.  Hard to understand why you didn't just register and get your key.  Service in the bar on the 14th floor was slow.  Communication in English was near impossible.  Drinks were terrible and overpriced. Items on the menu didn't seem to be available but communication issues made the process confusing at best. ‚Ä¶",4
Great hotel!  Great service.Rooms had wonderful amenities.  Gym is clean and well equipped.  Breakfast was great. Service perfect and friendly   Location was perfect.  Service wonderful. Great value. Would highly recommend it. ,5
Last night we went dinner for dinner at the hotel restaurant the Legend Club and we had the worst experience. The waiters were condescending and basic customer service was non existent. We had to wait 1h30 to get our food while the restaurant was almost empty. The food was mediocre and we were still charged for everything (even after we complained). I would not recommend this place. Very poor service and mediocre food.,1
"This was a business trip for my team and from check-in to check-out was seven days.  The hotel service experience here was outstanding!  From the greeting at the main entry, through check-in, multiple restaurant venues and the hotel amenities, the staff at each venue was gracious, knowledgeable, helpful, and made a genuine effort to meet our needs.  At The Legend Club on the 15th Floor, the venue was very clean and perfectly set-up.  Restaurant supervisor Amine, head waiter Ashraf, and waiter Yussef demonstrated what really great service should look like.  They recommended Moroccan dishes, explained how the chef would prepare them,  and were incredibly attentive.  Our water glasses were refilled regularly and each course was delivered with a flourish.  In the main lobby where we met each day, concierge Fatima greeted us and saw that we had coffee and water every time we sat down.  Our rooms were clean and the bathrooms were spotless!  The surrounding area has numerous shops, restaurants,and is quite safe by continental standards.  We can easily recommend this hotel for business or tourism.  An excellent choice and the price is very reasonable!‚Ä¶",5
"Used to go there before the pandemic and was waiting for it to reopen to go back again. Unfortunately we had the worst experience anyone can have. We were a group of 5 and were stopped by the valet at the door for no reason. He told us the terrace lounge closes at 7pm so it was useless for us to go inside. We found it weird and decided to call the hotel, they explained that the lounge was still open and that we needed no reservation to go. As we went back there, we were received by another security guard who tried to stop us but failed since we were determined to talk to someone and let them know what happened to us. They all started coming up with stupid excuses trying to make us understand that it has nothing to do with what we thought it was. It seems like they all have instructions to filter people based on whatever stupid criteria, while we were complaining at the lobby a group of 5 random girls came in without anyone telling them anything at the front door.  That specific day we decided to drive a Seat Leon instead of the Range Rover sport or the Mercedes class E we basically drive. It could have been a viral social experiment if we intended it to be, it would have been a viral video on Tiktok. It is a shame to judge your customers based on what they drive, you don‚Äôt know what they carry on their pockets.  This is what customer‚Äôs service is like in morocco.  That 1 star is because i had no other choice, it is a no star place to me. And as an owner of a Travel Agency, i will never recommend it to any of my clients.‚Ä¶",1
"Spent couple of nights, great hotel and service. All was excellent with the service and the room beautiful. Food amazing and breakfast excellent and service very friendly. Front desk were amazing and very helpful. we will come back soon.",5
"Excellent service and very nice staff in reception and breakfast service I would like to thank all the staff in the hotel, especially the employee name is (Ayoub), he is very kind and very helpful , all staff are very kind üíê..........................",5
"Excellent Servcie in this modern rabat downtown grandiose venue where I had the chance to spend few business days. The service is rated AAA+, very super friendly staff, extra clean comfortable rooms especially the bed , the pillows, new modern design with 180 degrees tower view on the new city you feel very spoiled. A real definition of a downtown palace. ( near by a lot of shops restaurants coffee shops..)it‚Äôs the new rabat fancy area. All the facilities are great: restaurants serves diverses local and international  tasty food while the different atmosphere Are very exquisite,  Also they have the best breakfast buffet in moroccan h√¥tels with limitless choices all made to the minute: sushi, Salomon, cooking stations, fruits bar, vegetables, a rich combination between locale cuisine and international gastronomy without forgetting the good quality coffees to finish the breakfast in beauty. This Hotel is a must live experience while in rabat‚Ä¶",5
"We stayed here one night while on a group tour.  The hotel is very nice, clean and great staff that works here.  Bed was very comfortable and breakfast was good. Several of my friends went to the spa and they said it was very good service too.  Highly recommend to stay here.",5
"Good location and nice view . perfect staff on front desk, amazing services and recommended for everyone in business or family vacation.  Cooperative with the visitors for anything needed.  Good luck for them.",5
I really felt the staff cared about me as a guest and the meal I had in the restaurant was lovely with the waiter being very aware if I needed anything without being intrusive. The housekeeping was very good and also the laundry service.  Thank you I will come here again,5
"The rooms are decent with some exception: the bed linen has an unpleasant smell. Room service is unfortunately really bad: very slow, expect to wait minimum 60 min to 90-100 minutes for your food delivery. Once your order arrives is usually incomplete or not at the quality you might expect. Whoever is responsible for the food & bevarage department for sure has no clue how to organize his/her team.  Service is terrible!!",1
"The view hotel had been selected for our 3 days stay in Rabat.  We experienced a great stay in all the ways.  Upon arrival a lovely hostess Mrs Jihane welcomed us, offer us a drink and assist with all the check in process.  A nice welcome snack was waiting us in our rooms (was replaced daily with different sweet or salt delicacies)   Our Panoramic rooms were nicely decorated and fully equipped (coffee and tea station also), the WIFI in the rooms and the hotel was very fast. The bathrooms are so luxurious and big. Do not miss to visit the open area bar on the 14th or 15th floor (not sure which floor) where you can enjoy a fantastic cafe au lait or a snack (smoke friendly too). The heated pool is also a place to be!!!! Around the area - which is not a shopping one - you can find‚Ä¶",5
"The air-cond wasn't working and it was 30 degrees inside the rooms. The staff told me to just open my window but they have these huge neons, and horning in the streets whole night. I just couldn't sleep.",1
"Pleasantly surprised.  Welcome drink & cookies. Lobby filled with flowers and lovely music played by pianist. Hotel staff friendly, helpful  and cheerful.  Rooms were big, clean, spacious with bathrobe and slippers plus coffee & tea provided.  Toilets with complete amenities & a  nice powerful hairdryer. Dinner was delicious.  Free WiFi.  ",4
"It was my second visit to Rabat but the first time in this hotel. The services of any place starts from the first hello at the reception and i felt the presence of a real welcoming feeling through eyes and gestures of all staff in this hotel . I stayed five nights that vanished faster than expected and enjoyed peaceful , uninterrupted sleeps .I think this hotel is one of the places that all people will agree upon its success and will score excellent in all reviews in future.",5
"Traveling to Morocco for the first time on a package tour from Hong Kong, the hotel locality is not important but clean, comfortable bed were much welcome after a long haul from home. I particularly liked the bathroom shower, it has a rock bench to sit down. The lift takes a bit trial & error to get to the floor, one of those computer selected lift car type. Breakfast was good and soon after we started the tour around Morocco.",4
"Great day visit sp√©cial thanks to ais ha Who is excellent interpersonal skills and very welcoming to the guests  also location close to mahaj riad (Shops.restaurant, caf√©s. Etc ) Th√© h√¥tel was easy to reach the staff was very hospitable",5
"Very disappointed by this hotel which is supposed to be one of the best in Rabat. We had a conference and rented 23 rooms. One of the waiter was rude at breakfast. the staff is lost and is apparently not trained. The bed was horrible, the bathroom door was stuck and I could close it. The view from the room was another building. the only nice view was from a glassed elevator. I won't go back",2
"The hotel is a five star hotel. Five stars only in theory. Awful service and overpriced. I am in Rabat for business and i went for dinner tonight. The amateurs have booked the restaurant for a kind of meeting and the rest of the guests are not allowed to go for dinner. There is also a bar that serves something to eat but it was also booked. So i ve been told that i could have dinner either in my room or in 15th floor restaurant which is tooo expensive. I asked for the duty manager and magically they made a table for me. The whole aproach is simply pathetic. The house keeping is also very poor. Facilities in the bathroom were inoperable, they never refillelld the complimentary tea and water in my room. Avoid this hotel. I have been in Rabat 5 times, this the worse hotel‚Ä¶",1
From the comfortable room to the fresh orange juice at breakfast this hotel is worth a visit. I was on a short business trip. A few things need improvement though. I like to do laps in the pool early in the morning.  They should consider opening it before 9. 6 am would be a good idea. The rooms dont really have a chair that you can sit to work along the counter cum desk. Perhaps they have other rooms that you can request that are more work friendly. I stayed in a legend room with a great view. The cedar terrace is a nice place to wind down after a busy day. ,5
"The location is good, but worse housekeeping ever. You will only get a bottle of water once, and no bathroom towel after you used them. It is like you have to ask them for a favor to get the essentials amenities. So, if you are thinking to stay here then think twice.",1
"Sincere and friendly interaction with all staff all of the time from arrival through check out.  Impressive lobby - pleasant, responsive, well groomed and professional attired staff.    Calming, soothing and invigorating scents while waiting for the high tech elevators.  A quiet, beautiful and Exceptionally clean room with plenty of space; inviting bed with plush pillows.  Great TV and working remote (100% connection from remote to tv when switching channels).    Love the bathroom; especially the shower (lots of space) and shower heads (great flow and pressure).  We extended our stay for a day at the View (to visit Tangier and a quick trip via ferry to Spain for lunch and to see Gibraltar).  Came back to a pleasant after noon surprise in our room - macaroons, fruit and a sweet‚Ä¶",5
"This is my second times here in this hotel. What I like about this place is all about the services. Every hotel staff is so nice and friendly, they are so helpful and they can recognize there guest each one of them. This is a charming of people who pay attention on there job. The room is nice and clean with everything you need; big wall flat screen tv, big bed , big shower and toilet. The breakfast is also great with all variety of food to choose from. They also have a spa and bar with a very nice view. The WIFI signal is very strong through out the hotel premise and it is free. Nice surroundings area with shop and restaurant. I love this hotel.",5
"I came at this wonderful hotel through my work. I adored everything!! The kindness of the staff,the spa services ..the view of the room and especially the morning breakfast buffet which was so varied and delicious, it is for sure that i'll plan to come back and bring my family with me this time!!!",5
"A gem hidden in the hotel, so hidden that even it is not in Tripadvisor. We have been having lunch and dinner few times this week, and previous trips snd it is simple delicious, the best of the hotel! Twice I went to the Legend, another restaurant in the hotel ... it was very disappointing, but Le Sensya is really amazing. Chicken Tajine, John Dory Fiorentine, desserts!! Thursday nights buffet",5
"The amenities and high quality staff responsiveness from everyone janitors, concierges, bar tenders, waiters, elevator attendants, hammam employees are exceptional.  Postal service, assistance working on the 14th floor terrace for business projects makes me feel like this is a home away from home.",5
"I spent two nights at the view hotel, i had a room with an amazing view. The hotel location is close to everything it s in the center of rabat. The staff is very helpful and professional, they helped me during my whole stay.  I recommend it!!",5
"I stayed here while on business in Rabat. The check in took rather a long time but staff were pleasant throughout. The security guys by the entrance to the hotel always had a smile and a hello.    The hotel is very well appointed with a lovely rooftop bar with views over the city.  I really enjoyed the mint tea and cake in the bar.    My room was nice, with a very large shower and an extremely comfortable bed.  Everything was very clean and well maintained and I slept really well.  I ordered room service one night and the French Toast dessert was absolutely amazing.  It was the best thing I ate in Morocco.    Breakfast had a really good range of food on offer.  It was a bit difficult getting someone to come over and take a coffee order.  I think the staff should be a bit more‚Ä¶",4
"I spend the night and checkin was slow but hospitality covered for it as they helped be find a change place and walked with me to make sure. The room was nice, clean but the main thing that wow me was the restaurant on the top floor. The view at sunset was magnificent and the food... the food was 5 stars and great service. This morning breakfast was basic with slow service.",4
"Great hotel with excellent service. The rooms are spacious and very well equipped, with a large bathroom. They serve a very good breakfast with plenty of choices. But most of all, I like the courtesy of the staff. They are very helpful with the ambition to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Especially the professionalism and friendliness of Aicha (PR Manager) deserves a special mention. After more than 10 business related visits, every new stay feels like coming home. I highly recommend this hotel! With a better swimming pool and a smoother service during breakfast, I would certainly rate it excellent.",4
"i really like the ambiance and the courtesy of te personel. i was personally impressed by the manager of the SPA and Gym Coach, Nawal. I agve her AAA ( triple A). very experimented and professional. Gave me a lot of great exercises to do.  the hammam and massage are also a must to try !",5
"The location of this hotel is marvelous.  Plenty of restaurants, businesses and shops are in walking distance.  The staff is helpful and friendly and the decor is modern and well maintained. The rooms are spacious and have all the simple little things you expect in a room like mini refrigerator, clothes iron and kettle.   The restaurant on the terrace has a wonderful view. The food was good and service was fast and good. Breakfast was also good with plenty of different choices and a great omelet station. For a business meeting, I liked this hotel.",4
"I had a great time, service and support. I stayed at the Hotel for 4 nights and everything was excellent. Specially the public relationship manager aicha she was very professional, helpfully and helped me to solve and issue when she heard about it while was walking in the lobby. Also, chaimae at the reception is really awesome and helped me very much during my stay. They follow up on any requests with in minutes... I highly recommend this Hotel in Rabat.",5
"Service is good. But the pool has no sign of how deep the water is. And turned out to be 1.5m and the other side is 2m deep, really scared out of me. There‚Äôs also no lifeguard, no life bouy, and the water is too warm like a hot spring, ventilations is poor, anyone who has high blood pressure should really be careful of swimming there. Also I got locked up in the lobby wash room, cuz the lock didn‚Äôt work and I couldn‚Äôt open the door from inside. Fortunately I finally got out, but the safety awareness should really improve in the View Hotel. ",4
Very nice property with amazing view. Rooms are clean and staff are friendly and would take the extra mile to make your stay even more comfortable. Easy and fast check in and out. Located in a nice area and has a Starbucks nearby which is for me is a plus. ,5
"I spent not much time, but I really enjoyed it. Very comfortable rooms, WiFi and TV that speaks couple languages, just be patient and choose.  Service at the reception could be better, I mean faster and multiclient service, because there is not the only person available. And coordination between personnel shall be better - we paid on arrival, but on departure were asked to pay again. Of course, corrections in the system were made, but it took time and spoiled morning.   If you stay in hotel, try to meet Ms. Aicha. She is super helpful to organize your leisure time - advices where to taste local food, what to see in a city and even arranges transport for your sightseeing if you are limited in time. More over, she is fluent in couple languages, including russian, what was surprise‚Ä¶",4
My 10 year old daughter and I spent 6 nights at The View in Rabat. We were treated so well by the team that I felt I had to write this - not something I ever do! The hotel and spa are fabulous. We were looked after particularly well by A√Øcha concierge who organized the perfect half day tour of Rabat and Chaime at reception who helped us extend our reservation.  Thank you all for a memorable stay,5
"Given the cost, one would expect towels, showercap etc sheer basic elements, but I had to ask!. No water available in the room to drink. Fridge empty. Cuisine not great either.  Staff v polite. Management needs to wake up and address these problems. Will be going back to using Hotel Tour Hassan in Agdal next time. Far superior service for same price!",3
"Given that this is listed as a luxury hotel and is located In the business district one would expect a swift check in. With only one receptionist to check in travellers it takes more than 30 minutes ! Response was - this is how it is and they have no additional staff!  No sorry, no empathy at all !   Definitely bad customer service. ",3
"Located minutes away from Rabat city center.  Hotel, 5-star hotel features rooms and suites, bar, cafe and restaurant and MICE area. Complimentary open air parking. Non wheelchair accessible.  The legend club, international and Moroccan gastronomy restaurant, lunch and dinner. Restaurant features non-smoking indoor seats over a few tables of two and four persons. Ambience is intimate, Jazz lounge and Arabic music with a live band with singer, piano, drum and Oud, an arabic guitar, subdued light, simple modern furniture and decoration, floor-to-ceiling glass windows, panorama over Rabat city. Menu proposes a couple of vegetarian options, a many pescatarian and non vegetarian options, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Menu is inspired of international and Moroccan gastronomy,‚Ä¶",4
"I stayed at The View last week for several days in January.  I noticed the security at the front immediately. There is a metal detector and several security men.  I felt very safe. My check-in was very quick and easy.  The staff was very helpful at getting me to my room and taking care of my luggage.  My room was very large and comfortable.  The bathroom also was very large and luxurious with a really interesting shower.  I didn't eat at the restaurant but the neighborhood is near shops, banks (and ATMs), and other restaurants.  I had a wonderful stay.  The hotel booked a driver and car for myself and two friends and we had a wonderful day traveling in Morocco.  My only issue was that one night I went to sleep early (around 8 pm) and a woman opened my room door with a keycard‚Ä¶",5
"Really enjoyed my time in the lounge (cedar), view, service and menu. All with a high standard for a luxurious place. Special thanks to Kamal and Bouchaib for their good service and professionalism, which i really appreaciate . Many thanks to all The View team",5
"This newly built hotel is located in one of the nicest streets in Rabat, next to restaurants, cafes and shops.  The staff are very professional, the rooms are modern, clean and fully equipped.  Restaurants and other facilities were professionally organised and managed. I strongly recommend this hotel if you have a buiness trip to the Moroccan capital",4
"No kidding around. The view is the best hotel I‚Äôve stayed in while in Morocco.  The location is close to some very good mid- price range restaurants.  About $4 US cab ride 15 minutes to the pier and Medina. But, like anywhere it‚Äôs the people and the service. I felt at home right when I got out of the cab. Top to bottom the staff is friendly without pretense. Specifically my wife and I want to mention: Ghizlane,Jihane,soukaina,achraf,jafar-etna mallam-,Raina,- and thistophne. They even took my wife‚Äôs broken bracelet home and fixed it for me. It‚Äôs the place.",5
"Stayed previously in Casablanca and Marrakech, never thought Rabat would rival these more popular cities in quality of hotel. ""The view"" is definitely the place to say at if ever in Rabat. Subtle quality delivered with ease..",4
The rooms were very nice.  The spa was great! Especially if you get the Hammam! Google Hammam if you don‚Äôt know what it is. Rabha was the best Hammam giver!  The location was in the center of town so handy for walking and getting around. The staff was very attentive and helpful. ,5
overall it is a good hotel to stay with peace and surroundings are nice for an evening walk and some good restaurants and a few coffee shops would give opportunity to have evening coffee and dinner alongside the road.,4
"I went to attend a conferance and was positivly surprised about the warm welcoming manners, facilities were fantastic, service room impeccable and spa really relaxing. food amazing as the country is well known for its cuisine :-)",5
It is a clean hotel in a great location service are beautiful but the price a bit high I can recommend this hotel for business people  You can find some different restaurant near to the hotel I have small doubt about the noisy comes from the road and some drivers are playing on the roundabout at night time,4
"Great hotel with beautiful rooms and stunning bathrooms. Breakfast and room service also has good quality of food. The hotel is not located in the city center, but has a few restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. Would definitely come back.",5
I spent 2 separate nights here getting in late both times. No trouble checking in before midnight. Nice rooms (1 and 3rd floors).  Found the pillows to be a bit hard for my taste but could probably have asked for a change but it was late. Shower section of bathroom lovely...powerful pressure. Didn't have time to take breakfast as had to travel out early.,4
"I spent very good time in this hotel , very friendly hosts, great and beautiful building, very nice rooms, good restaurant, nice spa , the staff is very very good and professional, if I will come to Rabat again I will stay there .",5
"If you look for a convenient and central place to stay in the Capital than this is it.  Clean, friendly, great service.  The soul of the place is definitely Mr. Jafaar from Concierge who expertly and with devotion looks after all your needs and is even assisting after his working hours if need be. Bravo!",5
"A modern luxury hotel. Not cheap, but definitely worth the price. Very clean, good sized rooms. Large TV with plenty of channels in different languages. Modern bathroom. Large safe deposit box, suitable for a laptop. Good Internet connection. Very generous breakfast with a choice of hot and cold buffet, both international and local tastes. Polite and efficient staff - from the front door to the restaurants. Always greeting and smiling. The hotel is located in the middle of the new area of Rabat with lots of business and government offices all around. Plenty of restaurants just at the square and yet more up and down the avenue. Safe and nice looking environment. Very convenient for a business visitor, but a bit far from the tourist attractions in the old city (15-20 min by taxi).",5
"Liked this place. Much smaller than I thought, but what they had was perfectly formed. Great breakfast, small pool (very small), conveniently located with many restaurants surrounding the hotel to choose from. Attentive staff...nothing not to like.",4
"We arrived at the hotel by car after a 3 hour trip with a toddler and a baby to visit family. The staff directly helped us with the luggage and parked our car at the private parking place. Everything was overwhelmingly good. What a service!. From the welcome to opening the door of the car.   One staff member guided us to our hotelroom. She showed us the room, gave us some information about the wifi, breakfast etc. and asked if there was  anything else she could do for us. We told her that we needed a babybed. She directly called her college and offered us also a extra bed for the toddler. Within a few minutes everything arrived. He installed everything even the bedding.  The room was perfectly clean and the size was perfect.  We just stayed one day cause we where going also to‚Ä¶",5
"Very new and nice hotel! Staff friendly and everything is updated! Love the location close to hip and cheap restaurants. Staff spoken good enough English. Very secure hotel, awesome room with see through shower. The fitness was decent could use more equipment. The pool that I saw was indoor and very small. They have some nice restaurants on site with views of the city. I would definitely stay again.",5
This hotel might be alttle away from the Centre but then it is still surrounded by many restaurants. Rooms are if very good size and very well appointed. The staffs are very attentive and efficient too. ,4
I stayed here for 5 nights as training at a venue nearby. My hotel room was spacious and very clean and everything was very nice. Unfortunately there was not a desk and chair so I was not really able to work well in the room. The wifi works very well. My package included breakfast which had quite a wide choice. I ordered room service one night and I also ate at one of the restaurants another night the food was good. I found the staff very helpful and pleasant. I will definitely stay here again.,4
We stayed one night here. The room is big - two queen size beds . Nespresso coffee maker is provided in the room. The toilet is clean. Location is a bit far from the attractions area. Breakfast just average only but the service was good!,4
"I only stayed for one night, so I did not have the opportunity to thoroughly explore the hotel.  There are several restaurants, and the rooms are among the nicest I have experienced anywhere.  The hotel is away from the city center, but in a pretty upscale, business area of the city.  I would recommend this hotel, mainly to businesses travelers or couples. ",4
"Certainly the attempt is to be on top.Luxury,at least five stars.Almost,if they just would not decorate their bathrooms with plastic flowers and warn their guests they would be fined with 2000 drh if they dare to smoke.Right they are,but the tone is menacing and certanly not top.The service in the breakfast service was as perfect as the buffet itself.The waiters were directed by a very talented manager,whose staff was able and friendly..The soup,served our group in the restaurant was warm,at the most,and the dish,although prepared with perfect ingrediences,was not hot either.Possibly we were late,,but top means top.The rooms were perfect,the prices of the minibar,one Heinecken,mini version, five Euros,exagerated,unless you are intending to stop your guests from drinking‚Ä¶",4
"From the welcome by the guys in front to the tearful goodby from the same group, the view is the place. Close to restaurants, the medina and souk are a $3.00 US/15 minutes Moroccan thrill ride away. The staff is friendly, helpful and attentive. So,much so they deserve mention by name- here goes to the best staff I've encountered in Morocco: jafar, khaoula,jihane,mustapha, Sophia,hicham, reda,chaimaio,imane,aicha, meholi,sidimohamed, Samir. Long list I know but if they weren't worth mentioning - I wouldn't take the time. Great place you won't regret it!",5
"The View in Rabat is a new hotel in a great part of the city-- safe, upscale, and very short walking distance to all kinds of restaurants. It's the best/only hotel in the area. It is quite comfortable and the staff are all great.   That said, there are some little things that all add up...People say this is a five star hotel, but it's not...Not at the level of actual international five-stars. The hotel restaurants are odd-- no one ever seems to use the ""dinner"" restaurant (Sensya) on the ground floor...I mean no one.  The ""breakfast"" restaurant is Sahar, which I've only gone to on Sundays...It's almost deserted and they kick you out of Sunday brunch at 1030.  Odd, by any standard. Perhaps the biggest inconvenience is the WiFi...it's horrible.  Just horrible.  Horrible. Next is‚Ä¶",3
"At check in you pay a temporary deposit for the room even though the room was fully paid for by the company. This was cancelled at check out. Room was great, especially the bathroom. Had roomservice and the food met my expectations. ",5
"I've stayed at quite a few hotels across Morocco, and this one comes closest to a high quality hotel you would find in the States or Europe. Everything was in excellent condition, and Jaffar, the concierge, was extremely helpful and courteous. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Rabat. It is close by to a variety of great restaurants, to include the new Starbucks in Rabat, Paul's cafe, and the Mahaj Road shopping complex. ",5
"I stay nearly three weeks in the hotel, beneath the warm smiles and the sweet perfume smell in reception the hotel is not a business hotel.  The rooms have no workable desk space, there is no chair to sit and do work and the lighting consists of a standard lamp and two bedside lights there are no reading lamps.  The wi-fi is very poor on a good two you barely manage to get simple emails done, you can forget skype calls or any other business work using the internet.  The bathroom has a large shower unit which is kept clean and plenty of bath robes, slippers and toiletries.  The room is spacious with a huge double comfortable bed.   I was on the 12th floor but was told there was a water problem and after two weeks had to move suddenly to the 9th floor and huge inconvenience.  No‚Ä¶",1
"I am just coming to the end of a 3 week stay at The View and it is 6.20am. Why am I writing this view so early? Because I have been awake since 1am as a 'Private Party' was taking place on the 14th floor. All I could hear was the bass of the PA. The music stopped at 6am!!! The View claims to be a business hotel...what a joke. The internet is very patchy and staff do nothing to improve the situation other than offer a room change. All of my five colleagues experienced terrible internet coverage making emails, conference calls and streaming virtually impossible. I was unable to FaceTime my wife and family without continued breaks in the calls. Emails stacked for days. The only way to maximise Wi-Fi was to sit on a chair in a corridor next to the door to my room. Wi-fi extenders‚Ä¶",1
"nice place,. Nice view from 14th floor bar. But lifts are weird - operated by room key, very fiddly - and when we needed an iron it took five phone calls to get it delivered. Shower also seemed to flood the whole bathroom and drain very slowly. So could have been better, Very attentive staff at breakfast,",3
"We decided to go have a drink at this hotel.  Well well, first I arrived and there is valet parking. free.  Then, the security staff ask you to go through a metal detector in a very nice way as if it were just a suggestion.  Of course you cannot refuse.  Then you meet the secret-service-like team who escorts you to the elevator to the 14th floor.  They even press the button for you.  You arrive and another team takes you over all the way to the two vast rooms where your party is.  They serve almost everything.  The service at the bar and restaurant were excellent as well.  Very impressive.  Will go back.",4
"The staff went out of their way to warmly welcome us each time we entered and ask if there was anything we needed. Stayed for 5 nights and the hospitality got better and better. The outdoor patios and terrace are lovely and the rooms are modern and well-appointed. The internet in the room was weak and the gym was never quite cool enough, are the only two small negatives. Food was excellent. In a great, upbeat, vibrant, and SAFE area. I would definitely stay here again.",5
"if you go to Rabat and want a nice place, close to all types of restaurants- the view simply cannot be beat.  I've been to rabat dozens  of times and always had a great experience.  The view tops them all- great staff, friendly without fawning, quiet rooms, the staff and security were fantastic. Jafar is the man who will see that you are taken care of in every way.  Internet was fair, elevators are supposed to be something from star trek - and were frustrating at first. but overall great experience. Cab is $3 to the market- maybe ten minutes.",5
"Being an architecture student who travels the world, always on the lookout for the best new creations, I decided to stop by and spend a night in this new pinnacle of the capital of Morocco, the exterior being very well designed attracted me to get up close and personal with the hotel, as soon as I walked in, I was greeted with hospitality by the staff, when i told the about my intentions, they gave me a tour of the building and it's facilities, I was impressed by the beauty in the design and the effort put in decorating and the overall warmth of the hotel, before being escorted to my room the receptionist informed me that I was going to be upgraded. I was then escorted to the upgraded room which was a spacious single room. The name does not disappoint, there is a wonderful 180¬∞‚Ä¶",5
"Stayed at the beautiful hotel for 7 nights. Nice facilities but I was most impressed with the staff. I felt welcome every time I was entered and greeted by staff who seemed to truly care about their service. They went out of their way to care for me and my group, were extremely friendly, and by the end of the stay, on a name basis with many of them. I look forward to visiting in the future.  Any negatives such as the odd elevator operation, and warmth of the gym, can be overlooked with simple patience and understanding (calling ahead to cool the gym down for example). The staff and their accommodating attitude more than makes up for anything lacking.",5
There is no internet in your room. I have unfortunately had to stay in this hotel on more than one occasion and there is never internet. When you can they say they will tell IT but nothing improves. You have to stand in the hallway to get any reception at all. The coffee machine had no water and there was no water bottles in the room. The nesspresso capitals were gone except one !!! I called and asked for water and expresso capitulates. It took half a day and me calling three times. I had to sleep during the day and they were Maintenence some were on my floor and all I could hear was banging. When you call reception or room service the phone keeps cutting out. No one speaks English and keeps passing you to someone else. When your frustrated they just laughed. The bed is comfy‚Ä¶,1
"I recently stayed at The View, Rabat's latest new hotel. the highlight is the superb14th floor open air terrace and adjacent bar and lounge. The Views were amazing of the city. the bedroom was one of the most comfortable I have ever stayed in and the hotel and a superb wifi system, throughout the building. The only let down was the below average breakfast which on first appearance looked good but closer inspection and actual sampling was a disappointment. Not a five star service in undoubtedly a five star hotel. That being said, definitely worth a visit as its super luxurious and very well situated in Rabat.",4
"I loved my stay at the View. Brand new hotel! i was impressed by the true Moroccan hospitality as soon as I stepped it till the day I checked out 4 days later. Amazing service! Room is clean, spacious and calm. Exactly what I need for my business travels. The breakfast has a variety of Moroccan and western food. I loved the hotel restaurant too.  The location is hard to beat. Away from the chaos of the old medina, yet close enough to everything you may need; shopping, food, offices, etc.  Highly recommended wether you are on business or fun!",5
This hotel is a new hotel in Rabat they use new technology for the left And home automation service on the room the room are clean the finishing of toilet is beautiful the hotel located in very nice place so you can reach to any place in a Rabat  with short time everything is near to the hotel coffee shop restaurant spa area even the sea and ocean or near to the hotel so you can enjoy any activities without any headache I recommended this hotel for everyone who like to visit this city ,4
"I spent two nights at this brand new hotel in Rabat. It was just opened in February 2017.  The hotel is really luxurious in a very nice neighborhood with a lot of caf√©s and restaurants around. Staff are super polite and run to your help.  Just small details that are usually available at 5* hotels are missing to add more value to the stay such as cotton buds, shower cap, shoe shiner...etc.  The only negative thing I can say is that the internet is a little weak inside the room but if you stay next to the door it is better. ",5
Arrived at hotel and was impressed with hospitality shown by Hostess. Spacious rooms with great bathrooms Had breakfast the next morning and thoroughly enjoyed the buffet with assorted Moroccan style choices. Highly recommend this Hotel,5
"I spent 3 nights at the View and loved it. The service was outstanding, the rooms were extremely comfortable and the spa was second to none.    If you're on business travel or just want to relax, this is the hotel of choice. ",5
I really enjoyed my short staying in the View hotel.  The hotel is beautiful and I have everything at my disposal. The swimming pool is perfect for relaxing and the sauna is brilliant. The room was quite and big and the restaurant has some very peculiar delicacies.  Overall the experience was perfect and a special thanks to the people working there. The concierge and all the staff at the reception were very professional and warm at the same time. They were able to fullfill all my requests with zero problems and always smiling. I will be back!,5
"A lot of little issues that added up to an average stay. The bed was comfortable, but the shower smelled of sewer gasses and amenities were minimal.  Room door difficult to lock and no peep hole. Lighting was low, especially in the bathroom. Weird elevator system. Breakfast is very expensive. (Many reasonable restaurants in the immediate area.) ",3
"Modern facilities, and everything worked as intended. Fairly spacious rooms, and the staff is attentive and charming. Excellent food on the ground floor adjacent to the lobby, and a good bar on the top floor. The drawbacks are that, curious for a hotel aimed at business people, the work-space is awkwardly placed and rather small for someone intending to work on a computer, and the chairs are not designed for office use. Also, the rooms are poorly lit, with no direct ceiling lighting; unless you keep the curtains open, the lighting remains gloomy throughout the day.",4
"The hotel building is nice, but beware if you book just one of their basic rooms.  The rooms are very loud with noise from the street since you are put on one of the lowest floors.  Then they provide so little in the price of the room!  Breakfast is an additional 250 DH or $25!  They say there will at least be a kettle in the room, but that's not accurate and you can't even get a coffee or tea without paying $25 for breakfast.  There is no water in the room (or the gym!) and not even a glass for water in the room (although they will sell you a bottle for 60 DH/$6).  The Wifi is weak, particularly at night.  The hotel managers may be trying to make their money back quickly, but skimping on basics like water and coffee probably won't do it.  I am in Rabat frequently for business‚Ä¶",2
Stayed for a few days for business and had no problems at all. It's brand new (beware taxi drivers may not know it yet) and everything works. Staff are pleasant and not too pushy. Security looks good for North African standards. The breakfasts were plentiful and good quality. The Spanish restaurant across the road was very good. Only downside were the lifts - touchpad floor request. A bit too trendy! ,4
"Had a great week staying in this hotel, the rooms are quiet and the staff very helpful, the food in the restaurant is good but the menu was limited. Free Wifi which is not always the fastest but it is ok. The bar on level 14 is great, it offers views of the city on both sides of the hotel. One side is a carpeted lounge bar  with dj serving cocktails the other side is open to the air at one side so you can cool off in the evening breeze. One of the nicest hotels i have stayed in in Rabat.",5
My stay at the view was absolutely pleasurable time and the new hotel was superbly finished and the staff were excellent especially mr Mohammed issam who was at reception who looked after my every need constantly and was extremely professional at all times,5
"Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights during a business trip. The hotel is brand new and well located. The rooftop bar has an amazing view indeed. The staff there was very helpful and friendly. Special thanks to Wafae, Abd el Ghani and Hassan.",5
"I had diner last week at la Sensya restaurant at The View Hotel and let me just start by saying it was wonderful!! First of all, the hotel is really nice and chic, i really liked la Sensya restaurant,  it's cosy and had a nice vibe to it. The food was great, the personnel was very friendly especially the manager. Overall it was a pleasant experience and i will for sure be going back there üëçüèº ",5
"Restaurant has very nice view.   Service is very slow. Each course takes 1 hour to prepare. And waiter doesn't give enough attention to the tables (maybe it's too crowded?). It takes 30 minutes for them to refill drinking water.   There is no vegetarian option, at least on the day we went.  Food is nothing amazing, considering the price. I ordered a rare steak but got a medium-well done. The steak also came with foie-gras which is not mentioned on the menu. So anyone who is allergic to duck/goose or against foie-gras should beware. ",2
First of all  i  want to thank these very  nice  guest  And profesionnel working nam s  wafa   really she  deserve  a lot professionnels working And lot  of langues soo the is what we nead when we talk about hotels and thank you  too mr othman was  very Nice With us  so  plz keep working and smilling too  these is the Best impression  and professionnels  work so hope to cameback soon ,5
"I was on a business trip from 10th to 14th March at the Cedar Lounge, it's just beautiful with a lovely view of the hay riad üòçüòçüòç I was amazed. My 1st day I had a problem with the A/C but the evening manager fixed for me üòç and then the 2nd day I needed an adapter for my laptop to send important reports for my work and it was the same guy who bought me one from outside the hotel ..... what a amazing manager. his name is khalil üòç. The staff is wonderful, helpful .... I highly recommend it.  P.S : thank you for the nice service and special thanks to the magic gentleman M. Khalil.  Julie  Washington DC",5
"Would definitely recommend the Legend club restaurant; the area is very nice with a breath-taking VIEW of Rabat. The service was very welcoming and professional, a special thank to TAHA and the wonderfull Rayan.",4
