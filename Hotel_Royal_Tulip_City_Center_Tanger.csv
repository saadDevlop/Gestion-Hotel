"I went to the Spa center of Royal Tulip and i must say the indoor pool is the best in Tangier   And a special thanks to Dina & Asmaa who welcomed me , they are so kind and generous, the water’s temperatures was 29c which is so warm, which i loved about this spa",5
"I must admit that I am surprised with the vast majority of reviews on here that are giving the Royal Tulip City Center Hotel 5 stars. There is simply no comparison between this hotel and true 5 star hotels.  There is nothing remotely outstanding or memorable about the Royal Tulip. The location is good; it's near the main train station of Tangier, as well as the Medina area. I think there is a shopping centre nearby. It's just off a main road where taxis are easily available. Check in staff were pleasant, but nothing special.  The room was fine, but not thoroughly cleaned when we first entered. The curtains were somewhat dirty and so was the carpet in some areas. The size of the TV was tiny compared to the size of the wall. The main issue I had was with the shower bath. The water in the bath was not draining despite my best efforts to ensure the drain plug was open. I reported this to the staff at reception, who asked how long I'd be out for. I said it would be at least 3 or 4 hours and that we'd be back late. I was told that a technician would be sent to check the issue. When we returned at 1:30am, we found the water still in the bath. There was no message left for us or anything about whether a technician was available/unavailable. No communication at all. This meant we could not shower.  In my opinion, the breakfast selection was not what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. The pool area was depressing from what I saw, but I did not use it. Annoyingly, the hotel had no 2/3-pin socket adapters. It was definitely my fault for not bringing an adapter, but again, I would have expected something at a supposed 5 star. Lastly, the lifts at the hotel are infuriating. There are 3 lifts, only 2 of which are currently working. As a consequence, I, among others, had to wait up to 5 minutes on multiple occasions for the lift to get from the 4th floor to the ground floor. In addition to the length of time the lifts took to arrive, they were often full. This is annoying.…",4
"My son and I arrived from Casablanca before sunset, I did not stand long in front of the reception, the professionalism of the employee who occupied me with opening a dialogue in the name with me until he handed me room cards, the hotel was crowded with citizens coming to visit from Europe, you need to stand long to reach your room, the rooms are large and clean with Romantic balcony view, conducive to relaxation and meditation, comfortable bed, delicious full breakfast and staff waiting to fulfill your requests, surprising they could not remove a dark stain on the flooring!",4
"We spent a long weekend in Tangier staying at this hotel. The facilities were excellent. Food was good and location was ideal for us, as it was central. I cannot praise the young beautiful ladies at reception enough for all the help and assistance given to us and always with a happy smile.",5
"I stay 2 days in royal tulip it's a good hotel  and the staff also very good especially Ananthu,Jayakansar thanks them for good serice. I recomment everyone to stay here. The food was awesome brekfast will visit again",5
"Amazing experience, the staff were extremely nice and helpful. If you go ask for Lina or Asmae, they managed to accommodate me last minute and this is definitely my go to spa place whenever I am next in Tangier.  Would highly recommend to friends and family.",5
This was the beat breakfast in all the City with a great selection and only 100 diram   Great coffee and great selection of teas and even fresh mint   Muhammad was the main dining room attendent and he was so kind and thoughtful. He is the diamond at the hotel and took plates away and was so thoughtful and kind and really made breakfast so enjoyable and went out of his way to make all perfect!!!,5
"This hotel is quite honestly one of the best hotels that I've stayed in. The rooms are beautiful and spacious, the views are to die for and most importantly the staff are very kind, helpful and polite. Naoufal specifically went above and beyond his duty and was helpful in every way possible. He is a true asset to Royal Tulip and an amazing gentleman.  Special thanks also to Hasnae and Lina at the spa. My daughter and I had an amazing afternoon there. So polite, helpful and friendly.  Until next time :)  Darifa",5

"Great hotel, nice location, Amazing staff, and so professional services. It was so so clean rooms, quiet and good room size. The breakfast was awesome, fast service not crowded and helpful staff. I would like to thank Mr. Hussain in reception he was excellent and help us.",5
"This is your typically business hotel. Something you company would book if you had a short business trip. I would not call this hotel a 5 star. This is a 3 star by all standards. The price of course reflects this. If you are staying in the city a couple night then it’s okay but I couldn’t spend a week here. Staff is friendly, decently clean and breakfast was okay. Otherwise, a three star experience.",3
"From the first moment you enter the hotel until your departure, you are not only a guest, but the master of the house. The hotel and facilities are first class and constantly maintained. The interior is a very chic design, everything seems to be coordinated.  The spa and wellness area is just world class, a great atmosphere for sauna, hammam and your wellness :) The rooms are equipped with all comforts, and for little surprises the friendly polite and courteous staff is always around. A perfect team that is second to none. Reception, lounge, restaurant and especially the breakfast buffet. Simply a dream. You have the feeling of individual care by professional staff, who read your every wish from your eyes. Pure luxury.  This rating goes to the entire staff, which was unanimously…",5
"I would give 0 if I could! Absolutely disgusting.. first room was promised with sea view got placed infront of noisy main road! It was dirty mouldy bathroom and broken dirty fridge. Went to speak to the staff lying and rude saying they were full, as soon as we say we want a refund they found us ""magically "" a ""better "" room!  Managed to get another room after arguing about it for ages .. and then the worst thing happened to my husband, he got stuck in the lift with no oxygen for more than 40 min until someone came to help.. if it wasn't for my parents in law and other room guests my husband would have died in that lift. Even the rooms telephone had no signal so there was no way to call for help!  No one came to help! And then as an apology they offered food for free! And made…",1
"very ggod hotel in the city center, where a car is not really needed. the rooms space is great, clear, and comfortable. The breakfast is good too. for negative points, I feel the hotel quite crowded and under staffed, with a need to wait to be serviced sometimes.  In overall, we had a good stay.",4
"I will be very objective in my feedback, I have made several hotels in Morocco of different categories. I spent three nights at the Royal Tulipe and it does not deserve its 5 stars, it is at most a 3 stars. the quality of service is very low. the food is cheap. the room service is very bad, the reception is not professional. the breakfast which is included in the stay is of very poor quality, you can eat in a cafe better than that. the hotel is soundproofed there is traffic and there is noise from outside. the wifi is very bad I had to work on my data. It is a pity that a hotel to be well located is to degrade that its level of reception, rooms, catering. the hotel is expensive compared to the other hotel whose quality is 10 times better ",1
"Houssaine the Concierge and Mohammed the bellhop  were just outstanding in their helpfulness and kindness. I had a great view with a balcony overlooking the ocean. The room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was modern. The gym was quite large and they had fun classes. I enjoyed my massage, along with the pool and sauna (they could be a little quieter in the spa area as there were staffs taking loudly outside my massage room for half the massage). Breakfast was plentiful, and they made efforts to provide me with Vegan options. Houssaine even sent me up lovely flowers and a fruit platter. I'll definitely be back!",5
"I was there in january with my husband. We’ve booked 5 days. First we had a normal room. After a problem they did not only gived us a suite, but they also sent us flowers and a really sweet letter ( i think here name was hajar who wrote the letter) i also really want to thank Saad, he called us a 3 or 4 times to make Sure everyting is fine.believe me, i went to a lot of hotels in tanger, but this is the best. They really listen to the visiters and do the best they can to make sure you enjoy your stay. At The breakfast you have a lot to choose. ",5
I was planning to stay just two nights in this hotel. It was ended to be four nights. Location is the best in Tangier. Breakfast was amazing. When it comes to staff they were the best part of my stay. Mr. Yassir is one of the most enthusiastic and supportive hoteliers i have ever met. He gave me precious advices to discover Tangier the best. Mr. Ahmed & Mr. El-Hassan were very nice and professional. Highly recommended hotel for all types of travellers.,5
"We were making our way north from Marrakech eventually leaving to Spain from Tangier. We stumbled upon the Royal Tulip City Center because it was near the train station. Our intent was to stay one night and search for other hotels in the area; we ended staying at the Royal Tulip all three nights. We were in a large comfortable room on a higher floor with views of the mountains. Since we wanted to travel to Chefchaouen, Hajar at the front desk arranged a driver for a day trip there. She was charming and beautiful and loved practicing her English with my wife. She seemed genuinely excited when my wife asked to extend our stay. All of the staff was wonderful. Hussein, the evening desk clerk, made sure we had transportation to the Tangier-Med port when our ferry from Tangier-Ville…",5
A great hotel with extremely friendly staff. Very generous and welcoming. Especially Mr. Hussein. I highly Recommend this facility and it is definitely worthy.  Located in a great spot near the see and many cafés. ,5
"We stayed for two nights--and, that's one night too many to stay in Fez.  We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel and made the mistake of not deciding on a price before they took us. Upon getting out of the taxi, we tried to settle the bill, and the driver tried to pull one on us, but the concierge helped us with setting things straight. So that was nice.  We got in around 21:00 or so and were only given Moroccan tea on our arrival (some people have said a snack, too?--we didn't get any and were super hungry.) Check-in was simple. Bell hop took our suitcases to the room.   Our room was HUGE and HOT. This is December, why in the world is it so hot in the room? Glad that we could open the patio door. We kept it open all stay. The AC wouldn't work.  Our bed was comfortable and…",3
"We spent four nights at this hotel over the New Year's period and bought tickets for the hotel's New Year's Eve dinner and party. What a disaster! After asking several times when they would begin serving the dinner for New Years, I was told 9:00 PM. We arrived at 9:20PM, hoping we wouldn't be too late or too early. We were too early by three hours as it turned out. We sat down and after an hour we were presented with a chocolate bon bon. Weird. Then about 30 minutes after that we were presented with a martini glass half-filled with a cold seafood bisque. No spoon, you just had to find a way to gulp it down. It got to be around 11:30PM with no other food presented to us, and we had gone through several stages of denial, anger, acceptance to the whole nightmare, when they…",1
"PROS: - Top design with spacious and modern lobby  - The view of the waterfront was amazing, in the morning hours we could see clearly the Spanish coast of another continent  - The attached gym has its own building and two additional class rooms (spinning and yoga), fantastic Tchnogym equipments  - Perfect breakfast buffet with everything we wanted - Superb service  —> highly recommend!!! ",5
"I have stayed only 2 nights , the breakfast was great but the dinner need some improvement to have more variety like rice and macaroni  The reception was really nice but my room was city view which was little bit boring ",3
"I had the pleasure to be guest in Royal Tulip, Tangier, Morocco.  I will use this hotel again next time, higly recommand. Thanks to Ms. Hiba i have a new understanding of Hospitality management, Manner, Professionalisym and taking royal care of the customer! Please Thank your employees for their hard work and consider, without them this can be quite ordinary hotel.",5
"Great hotel - spacious room, very clean and nicely designed. We stayed with a group. Breakfast was plentiful and versatile - very tasty! Great location! Very good service, friendly staff. We spent 10 days in Morocco - this was our best hotel in Morocco! Highly recommended.",5
"We very very much enjoyed our stay at Tulip hotel. We were very warmly greeted with delicious mint tea and pastries and helped out with our lugagge. The staff are great, big congrats for the attentive and helpful staff ! Location is excellent! We felt so good! The room was perfect, the view amazing, the breakfast so delicious. We loved our stay, will definitely return!",5
"This is our first time to Morocco and we could not have been more impressed. The hotel had luxury accommodations and was very clean.  The staff was very kind, generous , and gracious.  They were very eager and willing to help us. Reception helped us the most; we asked for recommendations regarding restaurants and sights around Tangier and we’re not disappointed!. They called us taxis whenever we needed and even changed our currency for us. Meryem ,one of the receptionists,was a huge help to us. She was so kind and helpful, and answered every question we had. You can easily tell she is passionate about her work and was eager to help. The food was excellent and room service was easy and quick. Wassima was also a very helpful receptionist and helped us feel at ease and excited for…",5
"I stayed in this hotel on a 9 day business trip to Tangier.  I found the accommodation to be neat and tidy, with all of the services I needed.  There are two main restaurants. One is a buffet at a fixed price and the second is an al la carte restaurant.   The buffet is excellent with a wide range of starters, entrees and deserts. However, the coffee machine is not available.  Vasco, the al la carte restaurant is excellent also , with a good choice of fish or meat.  On a slight downside, I found the room cleaning service a little lacking. As:- - Carpet not vacuumed daily  - Used bathroom items not removed.  - Only one sachet of Nescafé left daily,    which is a little mean! - No coffee whitener/ milk sachets to accompany room coffee.   There’s also a bar which specialises in…",3
"Nice experience. Smooth check-in process, welcome drinks. A special thank you to Saad Boumraya, the Rooms Division Director, for it's warm welcome and for upgrading one of our rooms to a Suite, we were a family of 4, so it couldn't be more timely. Rooms are clean, cozy and spacious. Staff in general was nice and ready to help at any time. Easy check out. Great service all around. This will definitely be my go to Hotel any time I am in Tangier. Thank you !",5
"The staff was very friendly.  From the receptionist to the poolside waitress, we received friendly and helpful service. The room was clean.  The amenities were nice.  We enjoyed massages at the spa.  Breakfast was ok. The music at the pool was very loud, and although there were primarily families at the pool, the music was very inappropriate.  Not only was it filled with curse words, but it was also very explicitly sexual and raunchy.   At dinner, it was a bit difficult to enjoy the meal because of the little children running around the restaurant without any supervision. ",3
"The location is centrally located, the room was very clean, and the staff were friendly and courteous!  Additionally, the breakfast was out of this world, one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had and I've stayed at a lot of hotels! I highly recommend staying at this hotel. ",5
"We booked one week in this hotel, It was an enjoyable stay, perfect location, room was clean, big with comfortable beds & nice balcony, the staff were so kind, the receptionist Yessir, restaurant manager Noufel, smiley waiter Ismail, lifeguard Sofian & housekeeping lady who kept our room to high standard every day, leaving chocolate & flowers in our room made us feel special.  Hotel downside, it should have more variation in fruits especially when you are in country like morocco, music was little bit loud afternoon & should include more kids channels. Overall the experience was brilliant as family, we will definitely would stay there again & recommend it to family & friends.",5
"I stayed here for 4 nights in June and have to say the hotel is absolutely fantastic, food was beautiful,  pool was great, all the staff were brilliant. We ate in the al a Carte restaurant one night and the food was out of this world , would definitely recommend it. The staff were really good if you needed anything and always there at your beckoned call. I can also recommend the brandy and cigar bar, it has a great relaxed feel to it and the drinks are reasonably priced with a great selection. I think I will be back soon on another business trip and will definitely book into this hotel again. Fantastic place ",5
"The staff were fantastic, highly professional and welcoming from reception check in to the house crews. The room was lovely and very comfortable, spacious, bright and with a balcony to 'people spot' from. Plenty of coffee/tea in the room and bathroom complimentary toiletries too. Shortly after my check in, the floor manager checked that everything was to my satisfaction. I don't know who was more surprised? Either me about being asked or the floor manager finding me in my jammies mid-afternoon.   I didn't eat in the restaurant that evening, however went down to breakfast by 0815 ( early by my standards!) the next morning and found the buffet a bit lacking as they had obviously been very busy before I got there. That said, the waiting staff were tremendous and made sure that I…",4
"We stayed last week 4 nights in this lovely hotel. De staff was very kind, especially two of them, unfortunately i don’t remember their names. One was a man who was working there at the 2nd of June in the morning, and the other one was a girl who was working the 30th of May. This girl gave me so many good advices for places to visit. The staff at the breakfast room was very kind too.  The room was very clean and the view was great. We had an upgrade, what we loved of course:)  Two points of critic; There was a misunderstanding about the dinner. I thought dinner was 340 dirham for two person (one adult one child) but it was for one person. That’s very expensive, especially when one of us is a child and the other one vegetarian. But they solved it very slightly. So thank you for…",4
Positive: + Room with balcony Negative: - Reception/Conciarge: The reception is not good in turist advices and it is practically absent in any assistence after sales.  - Restaurants: There is only one restaurant in the evening and the service is very slow. - Swimming pool,2
"First 5 star hotel where we got stolen our money! We were three girls travelling from Spain and booked a room from May 4 to May 5. First even though there is indoor pool at the hotel, you have to pay in order to use it! So we paid and entered and put our bags in lockers . After being in swimming pool and massage (also paid) we took our bag and only in the evening during dinner found out that there is no cash left in the bag. As it was hidden in the wallet under bills from shops it could not fall. After we went to check the room if everything is ok, we realized that from a bag of one money has also disappeared. We went to the reception to ask about the clarification for which they said it is issue of spa department and we should come here in the morning. Ok we waited the morning…",1
"i went to this fancy hotel, my friends and i to enjoy a tea corner that they have ( el momento ) , my 2 other friends slept in the hotel and they find it very nice , it’s a new hotel where the food is delicious and the personals are professional & kind !i highly recommend it.",5
Located in the Royal Tulip is a piano lounge called X.O Bar. Naoufel and Mohamed Guenouni made our night caps pleasant as we listened to the amazing piano player. The hotel is very nice but this was the icing.,5
"I spent two night in this great hotel with very professional staff. The service was fantastic, the facilities are clean and room is very convenient. The hotel is situated in a very touristic area, walking distance to the beach and a mall. As the parking space is limited, we came late in the evening but the staff took care of the car. The breakfast buffet is awesome with variety of Moroccan food.  I recommend this hotel.",5
"I have stayed in Tangier many times in other hotels and areas. This was my first stay in this one and in this area. No regrets whatsoever, on the contrary, i'll be back. Nice staff, large comfortable rooms, incredible breakfast, good hammam... Everything to make your stay an enjoyable experience is there.",4
"I loved this hotel. Centrally located in the city centre and close to malls, the corniche, restaurants, cafes and the train station.  Tangier now is only 2 hours from Casablanca by LGV (high-speed train).  The room is very nice and staff are friendly. All rooms have balcony.",5
"The Royal Tulip is situated very close to the train station and mall. The rooms are beautiful, clean and the hotel provides free breakfast.   Best of all is the staff--specifically Sabrine and Ahmad. They helped us get acquainted, gave us restaurant recommendations, booked tours for us and were just so friendly and pleasant. I can't say enough about how great the staff is.",5
"I'm a regular here and have previously left a glowing review. Disappointed last night to arrive as a walk-in at 8pm and being quoted the same price as any other customer, despite clearly signaling I'm a frequent customer.  Complained on TripAdvisor and directly to management the next morning and I received the apologies I wanted and a complementary upgrade. The management, specifically Mehdi, was very attentive and responsive to my complaints, which is ultimately the best one can expect. I still recommend the hotel.",4
I had the best experience in Royal Tulip Tangier. At the check-in they gave me a free upgrade to a see view room. Whenever I called the reception they were always available and friendly. I totally recommand this hotel for its staff and luxury sercices.,5
"Very good hotel, close to railway station. Good amenities (restaurants, bars, wifi/internet, concierge service). Rather calm, not too far from city center and medina. Large choice of food and wines. Taxi service on request.",5
"May be you find it a little strange that someone is reviewing a hotel that they have not visited yet. Well, I can tell you that my family went to this hotel when it was inaugurated back in the day. When my sister told me she has a conference there, I did not hesitate to decide to come and spend few days at the hotel and also visit with my sister. So, from Toronto Canada, I will God willing come to a hotel who impressed my family who are all travellers and know about hotels; and always stay in this hotel for the quality of the staff who are hired, the quality of the service which is being offered. I am looking forward to it.",5
"Difficult to express in words how much I enjoyed this wonderful hotel!   Had a lovely 4 nights stay, all was more than perfect from the moment of check-in (big thanks to Mohamed)  till I left.    The luxe suite with sea view was very spacious en spotless clean, so was the entire hotel.  Great sleeping comfort.   Breakfast was very varied, all fresh and tasty, a beautiful start of the day.   The entire staff is very friendly and professional.   Well worth the 5 stars.  Very good location close to the train station and shopping mall, quiet and safe area. Am solo female traveler, felt very safe.   Even though I love the charmes of the medina I was every evening happy to return to the comfort of this luxurious hotel.  Thank you!",5
"jumping over by ferry from Algeciras this was our first stay in Marokko - on our selfdrive discovery experience ! And actually after all, it was the best in super quality and ok-pricing. We consider this hotel on a good spanish level, super quality room, very nice Bell-captain Ahmed ( he was excellent and charming - super guy - ready for more in this business, I would believe)... we got nice ""walk-in-rate"" from flexible front-desk lady and had a balcony nice room - view to swimming pool and beach - breakfast for marokkean hotel standard extra-ordinary ! Tapas in 1st floor restaurant really excellent..... very nice all over and to recommend - try to get best rate, as in this country everything is negotiable ;)!!",4
"Let me say briefly; Stayed here more than 1 month. Therefore my feedback would not based on my feeling only but also my observations. First of all I want to thank Mr Saad Boumraya to have such a high motivated and friendly team. Especially to Kaoutar and Lina at reception. Many days I saw that hotel was full , where I didn't expect so much. Breakfasts provide large variety. Cleanliness of rooms and common areas are also in high standards.  It is located near to coast in the city center.",5
"I asked the hotel if laundry service was available, they sent staff right away to pick my up clothes, they listed each item and then had me sign. The next day my clothes were delivered with a receipt that didn't mention price just the list of clothes with my signature from the day before. When I checked out of the hotel, I noticed a laundry bill of 1625 MMD, which is about $170 USD!!! Very surprising that they would overcharge like that, it felt like a scam.  Other than the laundry, this is a nice hotel with a good location, restaurant, and pool.",2
"My friends came for my wedding so I was staying with them from time to time in their hotel while I was getting ready. They complained since they were there longer than i was, that the service wasnt good that they asked for things hours before and didnt get them fast(this is what they said) I on the other hand had a great experience I booked this hotel the night of my wedding as my room was cancelled in another hotel. Once I was checking in I saw the Barcelona team which was playing in town that week come in(maybe that's why the service was a bit slow, mind you it was August peak season) anyway back to the story. Checked in told them it was my wedding night and the manager upgraded me to a suite.  Which was just gorgeous and the service the next morning was quick and fast for…",5
I book massage and hammam  The receptionist Lamia was very helpful and smaily  The hammam man Abdullah was excellent  I definitely recommend this spa and I will visit it again It worth every penny  Thanks ,5
"the service was very beautiful in the hotel, stuff very active and ambitious, specially guest relations they were very supportive and even drew an itinerary for us to visit the city, assured transportation and reserved restaurants for us  the stay was amazing i totally recommend it",4
"I’m at the hotel ATM, while I’m writing my review.  This place is one of the best in Tangier, well located 2 Min from Tangier central train station, close to the beach. Beautiful sophisticated design. Lovely professional staff.  The food we had the was a bit boring and less than what I’m used to it in this hotel. Could have been better !",5
"This hotel is simply incredible, they welcome you with Moroccan tea and cookies, the bed was one of the most comfy beds i've experienced, the breakfast is just TOP. Their services are amazing. Loved it and can't wait to be back.",5
"Very much enjoyed staying at this hotel.  Stay was not perfect, but every issue was dealt with quickly and in an efficient manner.  As usual staff lacks training and facilities lack inspection so it is up to the client to report things, but that is usually the case in Morocco (unfortunately).  Very good location.  Excellent breakfast.  Very nice staff (except for SOME of the ladies who need to realize smiling is absolutely necessary when working in a hotel of this level).  Would stay here again.",4
Hotel is overcrowded. Staff is inefficient. Breakfast and diner is a nightmarre. Room service is absolutely unprofessional. And the sport area is more a discotheque than a place where you practise peacfully ! The best is that they do not even propose a towel for the sport. You have to bring your own...  To be avoided.  Ah yes .. the best is that there are some ongoing work next to the hotels and workers finished at 23:00 and start at 6:00... great!  ,1
"We went there with my parents for a night. Travelling around Morocco. From the beginning I wasn't satisfied at all but at the end I have to recognize  the staff (all services housekeepers waiters and receptionists)  and managers professionalism. A special thanks from my parents and I to two ladies not sure about their name oumaima and khaoutar you're tip top. Great location, rooms ok.  Hope to see ya guys next year insha ALLAH  Sophie    Sophie  ",5
"i Booked online, no payment until i got there. Reception service was excellent, especially from a young lady named Koupter. She made our stay extra special and extra comfortable. The hotel itself is in a good location, close to everything. Do not miss breakfast, it is fantastic!",5
"Stayed here three times in total, and each time, they do better than last time we stay there. We are always pampered in a very luxurious way. Breakfast buffet was the highlight of our stays because it had so many choices... Rooms are spacious and very clean. So calm... definitely staying there soon.",5
"Spacious rooms with good beds, big bathrooms and balcony. Very good cleanliness. Excellent breakfast with wide range of food. Excellent services including pools, massage. 2 restaurants, bars, large fitness.",5
"This Hotel is great. Large rooms, king size beds, cleaning is excellent, large bathroom with all you need. Breakfast is Top. You have a huge variety of food, and quality is excellent. Hotel personnel are very professional and are always looking to see what you may need. This is really worthing the price, well placed, near a shopping mall if you want to check local shops. I strongly recommend this Hotel as one of the best choices for a short stay in Tanger.",5
Stayed just one night while visiting the city for some working assignment and I found this property to be a great choice. Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Wifi speed was fair enough and the breakfast was really great with so many choices. Overall it was a very good stay an if I have to come back to Tanger this will be clearly my best choice.,5
"This hotel is really a great choice! Everything is modern and perfectly clean. My king size bed was very comfortable and gave me a good sleep. Most amenities were perfectly working, but only the WiFi, which is free, was a bit slow at times. Cleaning staff use a fresh room fragrance which I liked very much. The wall of the room as well as the floors are decorated with old photos of Tangier or some nice pieces of art that show parts of the city.  The concierge desk is a very good place to get some ideas about what to do and how that can be organised. Thank you.  The breakfast buffet was just good. Everything one would expect from a buffet in an international hotel was available, but nothing more. The staff is very mixed: some members are really nice, helpful and up for a little…",4
"My room was clean, spacious, and modern. The wifi is great, the shower water pressure is great, the towels are decent (but not great).  Sara at Guest relations was super helpful when I had a tech issue and with advice on where to eat. I can't comment on breakfast because I ate a traditional Tanger café down the road.   I recommend.",5
"This hotel is very nice ,  clean and the staff is very helpful .  Saad is a great person in the right place to welcome and put guests at ease.  Restaurant has very nice food and friendly service  Breakfast is complete and various.  Hotel is in a good location , walking distance to sea and shopping area",5
"That was my second stay in this hotel the atmosphere changed and I feel more welcomed. The staff are making more attention to details, I was impressed. Professional team and very good hotel. I will comeback",5
"Tangier is now so generous in terms of hotel accommodation. Still, it is so nice to get back to a place and get even more delighted. We stayed at Royal Tulip during a long week end. We had a business day but decided to stay beyond. The venue had all the amenities from the cozy rooms to the nice spa. The breakfast combines local specials and global touch. The staff is cheerful across the board. If you need help ask for Sara. She can make it happen from speeding up your check-in to recommending the right menu within the hotel. I will certainly recommend Royal Tulip be it for business or for a relaxing weekend with the family.",5
"We were here on a group trip to Morocco.  Every aspect of the hotel was excellent.    The room was large and very clean. Everything worked very well. Strong WiFi in the room.    Meals were very tasty. We ate in both the standard dining room and the vasco restaurant.    Staff were competent and friendly.    Only two small quibbles.  1. Shower is hard to operate. Once you figure it out, there is plenty of hot water.   2. Lobby has three elevators. They have separate controls so you need to press the buttons for all of them to avoid waiting for a slow elevator. ",5
Yes a Royal hotel. Nice and clean room with balcon and city views. Staff very friendly. Restaurant  1 first floor it’s elegant and service was excellent. The 2 waitresses were very professional and helpful. Breakfast was perfect. Definitely I will be back next year. ,5
"Amazed by the staff, they were at the service and very professional,  the room was very clean and the breakfast  buffet was so good! I had a very good stay with my relatives and we really  enjoyed it.  I highly recommend this hotel for everyone whose next destination is tangier.",5
"I booked a night in this hotel while traveling from Tarifa to Marrakech and was not disappointed. The hotel staff was very professional and friendly.  I injured my foot while out sight seeing and they were very quick to offer to help me to get inside the hotel and to my room.  They even brought me an ice pack.  The room was very clean (and I am a certified germaphobe), and the breakfast buffet was wonderful.  A perfect way to start the day.  I hope to make a trip back to Tangier and will surely stay at Royal Tulip City Center. ",5
"I work for a truck manufacture and for the last twenty years have organized an incentive trip for our top sales consultants, sales managers, service and parts managers at our independent distributors.  It is a consistent and ongoing program and is the best in the industry.  Well, the Royal Tulip is right up there with the best.  A magnificent hotel that is clean, friendly and state of the art.  I am ashamed to say I only speak English and a little German.  The staff was very patient and was very helpful going and getting an individual to help us out ordering and making some arrangements.  Excellent service and very thoughful of the guests.  I would recommend this hotel to all going to Tangier.  Also, amazing and wonderful city.",5
"Room is very nice , breakfast is good but service is not ready on time 1 day on 2 (i have done 3 stays of 3 nights in this hotel) , the hotel is not far from the front sea and the center (15 min by walk) , sport room is very good So in average according the price paid",3
"It doesn't have sea view but have very nice locations beside the mall , restaurant, coffees and 5 mints walking to the beach.  The gym is well prepared,the breakfast have enough variety and the stuff very very helpful for sure I will come again. ",5
"After an exhausting 6hrs drive, I've arrived to the hotel knowing that the Executive room that I have booked was downgraded to business. Why? No idea. I have yet to see with the hotel in the morning.   We booked as a couple and received towels for 1 person, 1 bathrobe and all the amenities suitable for a single person (including the room type itself.)  Stains are all over the carpet, towels are used up and look quite cheap... Not at all the service I have paid for...  The 2 star ratings were for the friendly personnel. Other than that, the hotel is mediocre and not worth the 5 stars. AT ALL. ",2
"Wife and I spent a week at the Royal Tulip.    There were a few glitches on check-in and we were offered tea and cookies as they were worked out.  We opted for the stocked bar, and enjoyed chatting with the bartenders.  The room was nice, and had a great view.  An easy walk to the train station, the mall, and the modern nightlife area the location was perfect.  Waterfront is a few blocks, and restaurants, ice cream and family fare abound.  Its a 15 minute taxi to the old city and there are plenty of options for westerners.  Highly recommend.",5
Wonderful hotel and staff. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Quite a luxurious hotel with every amenity you could need. Rooms were very spacious and clean. Nice breakfast in the morning. I would highly recommend.,5
I have stayed at this hotel for four nights. Location is good especially if one wants to enjoy walking by the newly renovated city center cornish. Staff are reasonably nice although they seem to need more training on hospitality etiquettes. Cleanliness is reasonable except for the corridors which are clearly dirty and filled with food and beverage spills. Restaurants are very poor for such a big hotel although the breakfast is not bad overall.,4
"On a recent visit to Tangier, my son, daughter, her friend and I stayed at the Royal Tulip City Center. First class experience all-round. Rooms were spacious, modern and comfortable. On-site pool lovely. We dined at on-site restaurant which had an excellent menu catering to all tastes including vegetarian with an modest but OK wine list.",5
"Very nice place neer to down town, fome some of room is posseble to see the sea and hotel pool. Breakfast is good, more swet as salt. The room is big with balcony, big bath room. The service was perfect. ",5
"This was a wonderful place from which to navigate our recent holiday in Tangier.  Everything functioned as expected. Nice bars and snack stations. Service staff very friendly.  Breakfast buffet was outstanding. The most prominent assist was from the head concierge, Mr. Bouayad: he helped in several ways but especially in arranging our two all day outings with a car and driver to Chefchaouan and Asilah.  The only downtick is that upon checkout the hotel did not offer us a choice to settle our account in dirham or in USD causing a surcharge of 3% due to their default USD option.  By the time we discovered this practice it was a production to reverse and re-enter the transaction in dirham. Aside from this minor annoyance it was an outstanding experience all around.  Highly…",5
I can't say enough good things about Royal Tulip. The staff is wonderful! I am vegetarian and the staff went out of their way to make me a cooked vegetable meal (that was delicious)! The following day they remembered my dietary needs and accommodated me without hesitation. If you speak english (or if you don't) ask for Badr. Badr speaks impeccable english and gave us amazing recommendations of where to visit and eat. I wish we could have taken Badr with us to the rest of the cities we visited in Morocco. Badr made us feel at home and became a smiling face we looked forward to seeing every morning. Thank you to the wonderful staff at the Royal Tulip! We will be back!,5
"This was a highlight of our trip through Morocco. Tangier was our first stop & their staff was amazing, especially Badr (guest relations). He helped us with anything from international SIM cards to local insight. We stayed at El Fenn in Marrakech & Four Seasons in Casablanca, the Royal Tulip staff was on par if not better. We missed our flight with Royal Air Maroc because they had no check in attendant (AVOID ROYAL AIR MAROC) for a 5am flight. The Royal Tulip staff helped us organize a private car to Marrakech, let us go back in our room after check out & sent us food. Stellar! ",5
"Royal Tulip was a nice oasis in Tangier. Great fairly spacious modern new rooms with great views. Quiet beautiful large pool. Spa facility was nice surprise. Nice lobby cafe...and hotel restaurant was good too. Breakfast was lavish. ATM in lobby as well. For a Moroccan hotel, this along w the new Hilton, is a top choice for a quick jaunt in Tangier. Clean, friendly, and nicely designed.   Bear in mind that once you leave the hotel, hawkers and would-be ""I'm not a guide!"" guides are all around the main beachfront promenade waiting for tourists to ""help"" but are then very difficult to shake. We had one who 'happened by' and then wouldn't leave us for 45 minutes - talking endlessly - and escorting us to the market...we had to get rather firm with him 5-6 times saying 'ok goodbye'…",4
"Nice hotel with good breakfast offerings. Lots of good restaurants and a major shopping center outside the hotel doors. Nice to see some English language channels, evening turn down service and small chocolate along with friendly staff.",4
"I liked this hotel for its new facility and modern decoration. The location is excellent for city center and walking distance to the sea and new shopping mall. Hotel price is reasonable and staff very very friendly, especially the reception lady (sorry as I can't recall her name). The point for improvement is the breakfast which was not the expected standard, and staff not really taking care for serving customers during the dining, and instead concentrating on the set up of the empty tables. I think they need more training. ",4
Very nice renovated luxury hotel in the center of tanger. Alternative and pro active staff with spacious clean and beautifull rooms. Great spanish tapes and pool. The place to be when in tanger and not only for business,5
"Beautiful hotel. Clean, comfortable and well located. Friendly and professional staff. Badr at the reception was outgoing and an excellent ambassador.  Outstanding food in dining room for dinner and breakfast. Perfect croissants were a delightful surprise. Many services for personal or business stay. Would be happy to stay at this hotel again.",5
"Breakfast is full of choices, room is very clean and even write welcome card with my name. Staff is very friendly. Good location near by the sea and train station! very convenient. The Spanish food is very good. hotel have day travel service with a nice car.",5
"This hotel is situated in a nice position for sight seeing and is close to the beach. The area has been redeveloped since my last visit a few years ago and is now very nice The hotel is beautifully clean, the restaurants are good with nice food although msybe a bit limited, the bars sre nice, with sttentive and helpfull staff. They screen foitball and often have live music. The rooms are nice and have balconies, big bathrooms and sgain, beautifulky clean. I haveto mention the staff. Ì do t think i have ever stayed in a hotel with nicer or more helpfull staff. Noyhing was to much trouble, even when i arrived back very tired from work they arranged hot food for me in the bar, totally unexpected. I think the hitel price is reasonabke cobsidering how well i was treated.",5
"Very impressive hotel, good and courteous staff, excellent breakfast. Close to eating places like Kentucky and MacDonald etc. Good views from higher floors (4 plus). Even numbers have sea plus pool view and odd numbers have city or big buildings view. Wifi is good except room 817. Dosent work in the room, why know one knows. So if you want wifi in room don't get room close to lifts.  (We used  cameltrektours.com. For transport to come to this hotel and around Morocco. Had very knowledgable driver Hamid.  Contact Moha 00212661821652.).",5
"Beautiful hotel, spacious room and excellent breakfast menu offered. I highly recommend this hotel for its attentive staff and it's great location for both families and business trip. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay.",5
"Well, what a beautiful Hotel...Brilliant Staff, Spacious rooms, Food was absolutely amazing with so much choice as well as the convenient location which is closed to all city's major access. I recommend this hotel for Business travelers as well as families as it is a relaxing place for a holiday.  Really enjoyed my Stay. Thanks,",5
"Tangier offers a wide range of hospitality venues, making it hard for visitors to pick. Royal Tulip has managed to set a great precedence. The hotel is located at the newly developed city. The rooms are meticulously arranged offering all the amenities. The staff is another blessing; they are behind every single nice touch, just name it. A generous breakfast and fabulous view we can get from the 7th floor.   One genuine witness towards the staff, they are attentive to the queries. To commend highly is Ms. Sara from the guest department and Ms. Chaimaa at the desk. I saw them in action at a peak situation which they handled with grace.",5
"In the Tangier for the first time visited the hotel. The rooms are nice, great facilities but what is absolutely excellent is guest relations they went above and beyond to accomodate us, in particular Sara. We tried the gusto restaurant and we found it ok.",5
"I visited to Tangier second time and l tried to this hotel. I can say that best hotel in Tangier. Location ,clean rooms,rich breakfast,fast wifi and very very kindly staff. Especially the quest relation Ms. Sara with her beautiful smile:) ",5
Royal tulip is a very nice and comfortable place to stay while in Tangier. Rooms are very spacious and well furnished. Breakfast is very rich. Staff are helpful and hotel has a very nice location near the new waterfront of Tangier,5
