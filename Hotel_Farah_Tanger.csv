review,rating
Very nice rooms in front of the beach. hotel is managed by local company and have a human dimension of service. people very friendly. Brakfast is interesting: Jazzbar and brasserie restaurant too. Thanks to management and employees,5
"Beautiful, clean hotel, very modern and fairly new with views to die for if you’re willing to pay extra for unobtrusive view, I had a part view but it was okay no complaints, they say you get what you pay for, But yes things definitely need to improve, main restaurant and only restaurant this time of the year, les Quatres Saisons not a lot of choices for your breakfast no yogurt and limited juices containers almost empty all of the time cold meat were dry and not at all very appetising.Jazz bar staff not willing to serve you what you ask for such as Bombay gin , large beer because they have run out and have to go somewhere else to bring it for you five star service I don’t think so, also be careful as it’s about £1 .60 more expensive for each drink, if you buy it in the lobby and take it with you you will save ,just have to get it yourself . They say they have a shuttle service which is almost never available, we managed to get him twice while we were there and on our 2nd trip he asked us for100 dh when it’s supposed to be free that’s just under £10 we said we only had card and would pay at reception. Reception if you need anything don’t ask at night nothing can be done till the next day 😳 Room was lovely and clean comfy bed and very good house maids, television is small with very very limited channels No football ( only in the bar) The hotel has very little (almost none) entertainment no show’s no kind of Moroccan restaurant , menu is very limited understandable this time of the year, with only a hand full of people but prices are the same so I think my 3 star rating is very fair because it not the building that gives you a fantastic 5 star hotel it comes in a package everything together…",3
I asked a lady at reception to use the pool for the day as a guest and I was declined. The reason for this wasn’t given and I was spoken to rudely and told to leave. You have lost a paying customer who will be telling friends that your hotel staff at reception are rude. I am Moroccan from England. I will never be coming here again. Me and my family have been coming to Farah for years and will not be going again!,1
I have visited the hotel many times in the past few years and have paid to use their swimming pool for the day with my family and friends. I arrived on my own on this occasion and the lady at reception was so rude. The lack of customer service was shocking! I was advised that I could not use the facilities because I am not a guest at the hotel and she then told me I needed to exit the hotel when I asked her when the rules has changed. The manner and attitude of the lady at reception was disgusting. To treat a customer with such lack of respect that you would ask them to leave the hotel? I’d love for someone to explain why this was necessary??  I will never be returning to your hotel and you will never receive my custom or that of my family and friends again.,1
"Okay let's just make it clear that this is NOT a 5 star hotel by any way, shape or form. I don't know how  they were granted the 5 stars, but whoever did that should be sacked for their great lack of judgement.  The hotel is located quite far from town centre and you will need a car to commute to it from most the lively places of Tangiers. It has a great view on the beach from the balconies. The lobby area is lovely and the furniture looked well maintained throughout our stay.  We booked our stay a month ahead using their own website and received the email confirmation. All good? I rang them 3 days later enquiring about something. They took the booking number and confirmed my booking and answered my query efficiently. All good? 2 days before our arrival I rang them to ask if it's possible to do an early check in at 12pm instead of 3pm, just to be told that they have no booking for us at all, we don't exist on their system and that we need to book again through the phone if we still want a room in their hotel. They insisted that there is nothing they can do despite me having an email confirmation with our selected room. They wanted to charge £150 difference more for the duration of our stay than we had in the initial booking. The lady who I had on the phone was really ill-mannered with no customer service skills at all. I asked to speak to someone else which she refused but then she agreed at the end to remove the additional charge and sent a booking confirmation 3 hours later.  Upon arrival at the hotel, we found a full-blown argument between the hotel receptionists and some customers! Definitely not a good start nor a good sign. We showed them the booking email along with our passports and then we were told to sit in the lobby whilst they're preparing the room. The manager promised it'll take half an hour but as we were hungry we left our suitcases and then left the hotel to go and have lunch in a restaurant. We returned 90 minutes later and guess what? The room wasn't ready yet! We had to wait an additional half an hour before going to our room.  We chose a deluxe double room and that's what we got. The room was clean but we expected a lot more from a so called 5 star hotel! Firstly, there was a musty smell at the bed's headboard which is a common problem in some hotels in coastal cities, however I believe that their hygiene standards should be raised to ensure that humidity doesn't build up on the fabric and upholstery. So beware especially if you're allergic.  Secondly, having had a long day, we needed to have a shower as soon as we entered the room. There were two basins in the bathroom but only one had a working tap! The shower head was faulty with a lot of limescale buildup and as I turned it on, the water pressure pushed the head to flip all the way up and resulted in terribly splashed bathroom. Meaning we could only shower whilst holding the shower head using one hand! To top it up, there was no water to have a morning shower on our last day and we had to wait for the problem to be sorted for nearly an hour.  The breakfast was good. The staff at the breakfast buffet are all smiling and helpful. But there wasn't much variety in the buffet, and frankly, I've been to 4 stars hotels in Tangiers in the past who served a much better breakfast.  Wifi was another problem. There was literally zero wifi in the room. Unless we go the balcony, there is no signal in the room. When I reported it to the reception, I was told that I should use my own data and not rely on the hotel's wifi. How nice!  All in all, I wouldn't set foot there again. It is NOT a 5 stars hotel. And as I mentioned earlier, I've been to other 4 star hotels in Tangiers' city centre which exceeded Farah Hotel by miles in all categories.…",2
"I had very bad experience in the breakfast specialty with ABDELHAMID , he is having very bad attitude and zero customer service and he is not respecting customers.  Its very bad when u start ur day with such people.",3
I stayed there on the weekend with my family of three. My kids absolutely loved the pool and the staff there were all smiles.  The room I stayed at was very spacious and the sea view that we woke up to was breathtaking. The breakfast was a buffet and it was very filling.  I had a great stay at Farah Tanger and I highly recommend it to anyone who are looking for a relaxing getaway.,5
"I have chosen this hotel for Spa treatment, based on its 5 star category. I didn’t fined any phots for the spa, but I thought It should be ok with the five stars. I booked over phone hammam and massage package for 600 drs, for one hr and a half. Since the first moment I was chocked with the locker rooms that was shabby, but the worst thing that its door was facing the male changing room door, and  lacking privacy in a terrible way. When they open the door I was half naked exposed to the corridor. Then I had to go with the robe in a common area with males passing around in their robes, that I couldn’t do as I wear Hijab obviously. So I put my clothes on, then the robe over. This lacking of privacy would be a concern for any lady that doesn’t want to be exposed naked While changing. Then I moved to the steam area that was below average, and definitely not a steam room in spa experience, particularly in 5 stars hotel. It was like a big bathroom, with brown ceramic all over and a cheap steal shower, hose and the steam was going out of a rusty metal pipe in the ceiling. The girl who did the hammam was nice and gentle but compared to other moroccan hammam, it was lacking care. She pointed to a family size plastic shampoo bottle, and asked me to wash my hair.( nothing herbal or organic, just a shampoo like the one you get from the supermarket). In my previous experiences in other places,  I enjoyed very relaxing moment for hair washing with head massage with good smell traditional products, and no body ever asked me to wash my hair my self. As it was very hot, I asked for a bottle of water my self and wasn’t offered one. I was taken to a room to relax after the hammam. That room has 3 dirty looking lazy chairs with scaly paint and covered with ugly blue towels. Over a side table, there were 3 left over water bottles there, but no new one for me, or a glass of tea or a glass of juice that I used to got in every place I had hammam in, as part of the traditional moroccan ritual. Then in 3 minutes, I was asked to move to the massage room, passing through the same common corridor with my robe, but they assured me that no one was there. In massage room that was a room for waxing, facial as well and other uses as I could see other  devices, The girl asked me to take off my robe, and I asked her for a towel to cover my body as I was wet, and it was a bit cold. It is a common sense to offer a towel to cover some parts of your body, while massaging other areas! But I kept asking again for things that I usually have. I told the girl to focus on my legs, then I heard an answer I couldn’t tolerate. She said that my package includes - as no one has informed me earlier-a light massage with no pressure so it is not allowed to press any where. I need to pay more, to get some pressure on my tired legs! I felt so bad. I wasn’t asking for any deep massage or special treatment! I refused the massage as I felt that I am abused. In the reception, they weren’t sure about my package.. they looked to the brochure and  they said I booked royal hammam, that includes light massage only. It was a joke!! Royal hammam with a single mud mask that was applied for 2 minutes and no drink to avoid dehydration( they said I should pay for a drink if I want after hammam). Royal hammam is the biggest joke after 5 stars Spa! This was really a trap, dirty spa! Filthy place, staff that lack the talent and accommodate clients need. If the hotel has the same managing mentality, what a shame. I don’t care how the management may response to this post, denying what has happened. I know how bad it was, they all know, and should feel bad. Unfortunately I was so tired and upset, and wet ( no hair dryer around) to take any photo to show the place. Stay away from this trap dirty, “the so called 5 stars spa”!…",1
Very good and clean hotel good food swimmingpools and nice staff near the beach with beautiful vieuws centre is not far and the boulevard is not far cabs are everywhere and kadisky restaurant and robertos are very nuce too for some food,5
"The view from room was nice. The room was comfortable, clean , large size, and has balcony. The staff was polite and helpful. Mr. Anas at reception was nice. He arranged a free ride to train station at check out time. The breakfast was good and staff there were helpful and smiling.  The hotel is far from city center and no direct access to the beach.",4
"I attended a conference in Tangier and stayed at the Hotel Farah. The whole hotel feels like a giant Moroccan palace, with small houses and several pools. The food was amazing and the facilities in excellent shape.",5
Thoroughly enjoyed my stay for a conference. Great views from the hotel and friendly staff. can walk around the coast and easy access to market and other areas. Good vegetarian food a challenge as they may not be used to many guests who are vegetarians.,4
"I was in the hotel for cyfy conference and inside the main hall , during lunch period after everyone left someone stole my item. When mentioning the situation to any of the workers or acting managers, they all seem ignorant and act as if it's normal. Very disappointing and unbelievable. Will never recommend visiting the hotel let alone staying in it.",1
"We stayed at the Farah Tanger for one night and were rather disappointed. Although the view is beautiful and the food was good, the rooms are in a bad condition and the staff was unhelpful.  As to the rooms: Broken mirror, closet that didn‘t close, mold in the bathroom, stains all over the carpet and the lock of our room did come lose so that it was more than questionable whether we‘d get out of the room again... As to the staff: we didn‘t have glasses for drinks in our rolm and asked the chambermaid both in french and english - she just shrugged and that was it. No glasses. Bad service! We won‘t come back, sorry. ",3
Nice stay with Nice bien at very clean and welcome hotel isolated from the city without being too far from city center Great breakfast as well with lot of choices of foods and juices Visited couple of times with both business and family trips and really satisfied,5
"Initial experience of check in was poor! The guy on reception who checked myself and my husband in, did not even make any conversation at all with us, he was ignorant and more concerned on the filling out of the usual forms. Every two seconds lifting his head scanning who was entering the front door on hotel, not once did he say, welcome or Enjoy your stay or breakfast is served here at this time or even how are you, never gave us WIFI password, No customer ‭service skills at all! Really unacceptable welcoming for this hotel! Room was nice, clean and spacious. Telephone in room wasn’t working, sofa bed also did not work and tiles in shower where a bit dirty with black mould spots on shower head and the tiles! The view was fabulous, the breakfast was good, plenty of choice. All…",3
"The hotel shows age and it is not being kept up well. The lobby shows age, the rooms show age the pool shows age. So we checked in thinking we were gonna have a good stay. We get the keys and head to our room. Besides the fact that it's probably one of the oldest rooms there its surroundings are dirty tea cups from old guest out in the hallways, ants, pieces of old bread, old trays. Went up to ask to be moved the girl said she had nothing available and said I had to wait until I mentioned getting an upgrade she then focused more on me. Once she realized the suite wasnt available she said I had to wait an hour that she would call me. So I waited, hour later came back up nothing she said I had to wait again I even left my phone number. Went to eat,came back went straight to the…",3
"The hotel is situated in a great aria with wonderful views. Everything is so clean and organized from the arrival to the departure of the hotel. The spa center is great, you will not miss anything whether you are on holiday with family or business stay. Smiling staff of professionals. Congratulations to all involved. I will certainly visit the hotel again.",5
"We had a really nice four-night stay at this hotel - to start with the positives, the room was very clean, well maintained and comfortable with a lovely view of the sea and Tangier in the distance. Tea and coffee making facilities were provided.The breakfast was fantastic, big variety and lovely fresh pastries (although they could do with updating their coffee machine). The staff were courteous, helpful and friendly. The big lobby area had a very glamorous and luxurious feel. I never got to try the spa but I wish I'd had a chance to! The outdoor pool looked lovely but it was too cold in January for us to use it. The negatives are less to do with the hotel and more to do with the area - the hotel is some distance from town and surrounded by half-finished building projects, not…",4
"Having stayed at the deplorable Farah hotel in Rabat the previous night, I dreaded poor accommodations. But I was pleasantly surprised. Buffet was good, rooms much better. Hotel has a stench of stale cigarette smoke, and although the staff insisted that the rooms are nonsmoking (really, there is an ashtray in the room), they refused to switch my room in the evening. This was alleviated by sleeping with the door to the balcony open.   Did not have any issues with noise.  Location is very good.",3
"Large rooms and bathrooms with decent amenities.   All rooms have balconies overlooking ocean.  Not much around the hotel as still a lot of new construction.  About 10-15 minutes drive to old medina with traffic.   Breakfast buffet is good with wide variety and wonderful pastries and breads however food is not kept very hot even on warming trays.  Only complaint is the shower.   It’s a high step in bath but issue is the spray hose won’t spray down, pressure is high and causes it to spray water through out bathroom.   Other issue is the hot water will suddenly go scalding every 45 seconds so you have to be careful not to get yourself burned.   You start to figure out the timing and ensure not spraying on you at those intervals.   Also watch out for the ATM machine in the lobby,…",4
"Stayed here because my company has preferred rate.  The setting is breathtaking as it overlooks the sea with Tangier in the distance.  The hotel itself has a very unique style (kind of Vegas-like lobby).  Service was a bit strange.  Checked in and was told to sit down while they check me in.  45 minutes later I asked what was going on and they finally finished my check in.  Then, I had to ask several times for my passport to be returned.  Arrived to my room only to have to ask the maid for towels.  Ocean-front room, pretty spacious.  Has mini-bar, nice balcony, plenty of bath amenities.  Ate at one of the restaurants twice and food and wine very good.  Service a little timid.  Breakfast buffet offered daily.  Room service was quick and efficient.  Had a glass of wine in the bar…",3
"First impression, from outside, to the lobby and to the swimming pool, it's great!  The reality is a very bad, unefficient service and rude staff (we have been waiting 3 hours for the missing towels in the room, with rude staff picking up the phone on the reception). Noisy: In front of the hotel (see side) there is a street and parkings, where, all night long, cars (with loud music) are stopping and people (yelling and singing) are coming: they enjoy the see view... Toilet not clean, water on the bathroom's floor, drip water from the airconditionning system on the floor, are just the most remarkable notes to do, regarding the conditions of the room, besides the missing towels. Well, I'll try to sleep now (it's almost 3 am) and, maybe, the sleep will overcome the loud and the…",2
"The view and the pool were outstanding. But that is where it ended. The service was dreadful with some of the most uncaring staff I have ever encountered. We stayed at this hotel as part of a conference, and while the lobby and general grounds were fine, the lack of attention made this an unpleasant experience. .... we are still waiting for toilet paper to be delivered to our room.... it never came. Neither did the drink- soda- that we tried to order at the pool side bar.",2
"magnificent hotel, best service, amazing ocean view, just pure luxury treatment. This hotel is only a short cab drive to the most amazing parts of tanger, all sight seeing or historic al places. For history lovers this place is just heaven",5
Stayed one night. Hotel is well placed with views towards sunset and has pools and lots of food areas. Room was a good size and the bed okay. Bathroom a good size. Staff at main desk and food area downstairs very good. Breakfast was quite good. One of the staff members in the Jazz Bar must have been having a bad day as a bit surly. Here are some renovations needed with carpet with big stains and other minor marks not giving a good impression.,4
"This hotel is a shocker! We stayed here for one night on an Insight tour of Morocco at the beginning of June 2017. At first glance, the place looks ultra modern and has a stunning view of the ocean from the entrance and lobby area but unfortunately, that's where the good news ends. Closer inspection reveals a hotel that has been badly designed at a detail level, it's been badly built and finished, it's clearly had little or no maintenance since new and to cap it all off, the staff look miserable and are generally unhelpful. Our bathroom was terrible. Badly cracked /smashed tiles on the vanity. The shower was a disaster. The shower head was loosely attached and unable to be adjusted and when you turned the water on it rose uncontrollably spraying its jet across the ceiling to the…",1
"Yes, this place is remote, but for one night it is wonderful.  I believe all rooms face the water, (althought it is quite a distance to get down to the beach, if it is at all possible.)  Having a small patio we left the door open and slept with the ocean breeze entering our room.  The hotel lobby  is absolutely lovely an pristine.  The pool is in a perfect setting.  Watching the sunset is amazing.  The rooms are a good size.  As for coffee/tea in room you hardly find that at most non-American hotels.  Breakfast had a great assortment of items, but you must remember you are in Morocco.",4
"The hotel is opulent, very richly decorated in a modern Moroccan way.  The room is big and comfortable but note that there is no coffee/tea making facility.  Room has a balcony and it offers a great view of the sea.  Why average?  Breakfast buffet was okay except that the staff in the buffet area will not refill unless you ask them to.  Also, they are not that friendly and accommodating.  Asking them to refill - you get a grunt from the staff.  I asked for paper napkins and they did not have any!!!  Coffee machine was not working also and we were served tasteless coffee from the pot.  The saving compensation on the staff would be the very nice guy in front desk.",3
"This hotel is situated a bit out of town (which is why I chose it). The views from our room was exceptional especially at night! Their breakfast buffet was fantastic with fresh hot foods served to order as well; plenty of choice and flavor. Staff was mostly very helpful. I had an allergic reaction to the carpet cleaning fluid used in our room so they upgraded us to a villa room. Unfortunately, it was a bit bare and needed fresh linen & towels.A housekeeping issue. After a phone call, things were corrected. I would stay here again.",4
"My wife Nicoleta Todirisca have had a nice relaxing week in your hotel. Thanks to mr. Mouhcen El Youssoufi responsabile F&B for his professionalism and kindness. We have great memories of Farah Tanger Hotel, of Tanger and Maroc. ",4
This superb Hotel Farah is out of the main town of Tangier; and is in a peaceful location. There are fine views of Tangier over the bay. Our wonderful room overlooked the good beach which is right next to the hotel. The sea was too rough for swimming at the time we were there at the start of April. It had also been raining.  The pool and its area also looked good. It was a pleasure to stay at this hotel.,5
"The hotel is well away from any shopping area or restaurants so visitors without transport are rather stuck. Our bedroom was a large spacious room with ample hanging and shelf space and a good work station. Bathroom had plenty of space for toiletries but the shower was an over  the bath model and not easy to use. The room had a safe, hair dryer and an empty minibar. There was no tea or coffee making facilities. A strange lack was any glasses of any kind, even in the bathroom for tooth cleaning. We arrived for dinner a few minutes after most visitors and found that the choice and quantity of food available was limited to say the least. Odly, the same food seemed to appear at breakfast.",3
Great place to stay for those who want to be further away from the corniche for a quiet and relaxing time. The corniche and medina is roughly a five minute drive. Great views with friendly staff who are attentive to your needs. ,4
"I've spent 4 nights at this nice and calm hotel. All things went well except the hammam and massage, which were poor although the price was very hefty (650 DH). Staff other than the massage people were very friendly and generous. Food was nice too.",4
"Such a warm team, happy smiling faces at all times. They listened to our needs and made necessary arrangements...even bring us hot bread every morning . Detail oriented house keep kept our rooms feeling fresh and the showers in pristine conditions. Highly impressed and would recommend this hotel to any one out there. I would definitely be choosing it as my go to hotel for tangier. Choukran the team",5
"All i can say is that i did not enjoy my stay at this hotel. The room furniture looked cheap and was not comfortable. The breakfast  was a disaster: the salad was not fresh, there were no eggs and no juice at 10:00 am! i asked for some juice several times and no body cared ( specialy the old man with grey hair, he needs to be more friendly). The receptionnists need to smile more.  one good thing about this hotel: the view.",2
We had the best time at this hotel. The staff was really friendly. We are road tripping through morocco and this was our first hotel. We are coming back too stay here within 3 days accompanied by my father and brother. Great food! Loved the jazz bar. The spa was also amazing!!,5
"Relatively new hotel near the sea, nice views, a bit far from the old city center, some interesting interior design features, but quality of service really not great. Breakfast buffet far below standard. Most staff apparently poorly trained. Really not that good, we wouldn't use it again.",3
The hotel has updated their lobby so much but has neglected the rooms. It has a nice pool area and a nice view over the waters but I would not stay very long in a hotel that is so remote and with not enough facilities.,3
Great hotel and excellent location with an amazing view to the ocean. Very helpful and friendly staff. Front desk staff was particularly accommodating and went above and beyond to assist with our specific needs. I totally enjoyed my stay and recommend it. ,5
"This is the best view in tanger because in tala ,but the service is very bad,we went there we asking for baby bed the receptionist said sorry we dont have today may be tomorrow it will be available -poilar not available in the room we orderd from reception we received after 2 hours-only two employee work as a receptionist one morning shift and another evening",3
"We arrived at Farah Hotel Tangier after an 10 hour coach trip from Marrakash so it looked like a nice place to rest our weary bodies, especially when we saw the grand staircases, all red and white!  However looks are deceiving!  The hotel is in the middle of nowhere, away from the city and the port. The whole place has an unfinished look.  There was absolutely nothing you can do unless you have a car or some other means of transport.    The hotel has a very strange way of numbering its rooms, with dark, winding staircases that lead to nowhere!  The only redeeming feature is the view of the sea from most rooms.   We had our group dinner and breakfast  in a huge, hollow feel dining room.  Both the dinner and breakfast were bad.   I am not sure why Trafalgar chose this hotel in…",2
Nice adress. I Stayed for a couple of days. Great lobby red & white. People are helpful. I particularily enjoyed the spa and especially moroccan hammam. The manager lady was very nice. The breakfast is rich and included. The restaurant room so large. The views in general are great. The swimming pool is good if weather is ok,5
"A reasonable hotel. Though expected better for the price. Well out of the city, nothing is with in walking distance, nothing. A long walk to the ocean is just scrub and rocks. Spacious room, small dated bathroom. Average but OK breakfast. Front reception desk disorganised and we saw several people having huge issues because there wasn't a room for them even though they had booked.",3
"i enjoyed the stay. Very helpful receptionists, especially loubna and asmahan. nice breakfast, very fresh and varried. the views are exceptional on two continents. i really spent two exceptional days and recommend this high quqlity hotel",5
"This may have been a 5 star at one time but no way is this a 5 star now! The beach view is so beautiful and the only part I enjoyed. I couldn't sleep because of some fake lemon room freshner. I don't even know where it was coming from to get it out so I could sleep. In the middle of the night I turned on the bathroom light to find baby cockroaches everywhere! The room was missing towels, linen, and other normal supplies. T.V. doesn't work well. ONE night and I was up to get out early!",1
"This isn't a 5 star hotel.we had a reservation for 7 nigths and only stayed one. Everything went bad. When I made the reservation I asked for a baby crib( that says on the website they have available), and when we arrive, late and tired, they didn't even cared about my request. I asked again and after 1 hour, one member of the housekeeper came with bed linen, delivered at my husband arms and gone away. The baby had to sleep in our bed. The room isn't confortable, and the quality of the materials isn't good. When you call to the room service they only understand french.  The tv doens't work well. You have much better places in Tanger at this price and even lower. This isn't a 5 stars hotel...maybe 4 or even 3 in some aspects.",1
"Our coach tour company, Trafalgar, booked this hotel. It is a good modern hotel with very good views. The reception staff were polite and helpful, however the service in the restaurant needs to improve, as does the breakfast food. The room was spacious and well equipped. The bed was comfortable. Wifi was free, however it appeared slow. They have both an indoor and outdoor pool and an excellent spa. They also have a gym. The air conditioning needs improving. The hotel is also a bit out of town, so you would need a 10 - 15 minute taxi ride to get to attractions and restaurants in Tangier City Centre. This hotel is not a 5* by European standards, however they can improve the overall customer experience with training for their restaurant staff.  ",4
"The hotel is gorgeous. Reception people are very kind, good english and helpfull.  Beautiful SPA but the staff should all have trainning, because they act as they are working in a 3 start hotel (very bad communication) The massage therapist did express massage in my self (and not good one) and I missed 15min from my massage (she just told me that she did 1 hour, but it wasnt true). After i complain about her mistake, she want that I take 15min shower, to get the correctly time and the recepcionist agreed with her. So dont use the spa in this place, they are kind try to lie to you.",3
Very cool hotel has a good view and great reception breakfast was okay but yo be honest the prices is not worth it there is good hotels with less prices but its good for new experience.. and pool was ok but i prefer suites was near beach and very romantic if u wanna dpend time with ur partner,4
"The room was spacious and the bed was moderately firm. There was a slightly offensive odor in the hallway, but the room smelled ok. Wifi was free, but SLOW in the rooms. I had to go to the lobby to even sync a Fitbit. Dinner was included for us (Insight tour).  The food was mediocre, at best and none of it was hot.  Lukewarm vegetables and meat isn' that great. I'm diabetic, so I tried to order a Diet Coke.  They didn't have even ONE diet drink. We ordered some wine at our table and we were basically done eating before it arrived.    I asked for an extension cord because both my husband and I have CPAP machines. It took over 4 hours to get one. At least the man at the reception desk was persistent and finally got one.    The air conditioning really was nonexistent.  We were so…",3
"Our tour company used Hotel Farah Tanger - very modern, excellent size rooms, beautiful views of the ocean. Service however especially in the restaurant was below standard and the breakfast was poor. Given the vast building of new hotels going on, Farah will need to improve these aspects. If they do so they would deserve a better rating. Bit outside of the town, would need taxi to get to town and bars and restaurants.",4
"Nice hotel over all, the room Is not dark so the comfort of sleep Is not that great not enough curtains, you will have to wake up when the sun Is up;( the breakfast was good nice variety the service was OK, the front desk not helpful at all, I asked for a different room they said that they were sold out when the hotel was nearly empty,  anyways overall It Is an OK hotel to stay at while in Tangier a bit far from the main attractions of Tanger (downtown, Medina etc...) The service could be Improved a bit",3
"We stayed at this hotel one night on a recent trip to Morocco. Nice seaside views from the hotel. I wish our room would have been a little higher, but we still had some nice view out over the sea. It was a little cool to use the pool, but it looked tempting. Great sunset. The hotel lobby was very nice. This hotel I believe was only a couple years old. The room was nice and spacious. The only thing that caught my eye was the curtain rod in the shower looked like a piece of PVC pipe. That and a couple spots where the stucco had fallen off the building. Spent some time in the bar. For some reason you could not put your bar tab on your room bill. Breakfast was very good. One of the places were you could get an omelet in the morning.",5
"Although this hotel is out of town, it is brand new with al the mod cons. Being in Morocco, we were surprised at how good this pace was. Meals at hotel were good and sleep very good. Staff were great with no problems. Only downside was location which was out of central Tangiers",5
"Stayed one night, as part of a tour. Weather was awful, so couldn't appreciate location/views too much! Tries very hard to be stylish, with predominately white finish everywhere - which I liked, but execution & quality slightly let it down. Rooms very large and well equipped. View (when we could see it) lovely, including view of Spanish coast. Set meal ok.",3
"Stayed here 1 night as part of an Insight Tour. We were allocated a Deluxe Double Room with a balcony overlooking the Swimming Pool, Beach, the Straits of Gibraltar and Spain across the waters, a North West orientation. White is the predominant colour in the hotel and the room. Room floor is carpeted and the choice of beige & white furniture complements the theme  - a sparkling bright and breezy resort hotel just right for rest and relaxation. Room is well equipped with Bathrobe, bedroom slippers, complimentary water and coffee/tea making facilities. Bathroom is well designed with ample bath amenities. Location wise the hotel is quite isolated with only other hotels along the same beach front. It is about 10-15 mins taxi ride to Tangier City Centre if one needs to seek other…",4
Hotel just over year old. Rooms well decorated with tea and coffee in rooms. On tour and found we were treated with scorn in bar and dinning room. Bar noisy when we change euro given back in local currency and couldn't book to room. Dinning room great view once you found it down long stairs. No direct lift to dinning accept via service area.,3
We stayed one night in April 2016 and the hotel is great but we decided to go to the bar prior to going to dinner and  they would not book a drink back to the room. We had to pay in euro and were given the back in local currency which we did not want. The front staff did not know of a lift to go down 1 level for dinner. What happens with handicapped persons?. The shower leaked all over the floor .,5
Not all rooms alike ...no view from any of the # xx28 rooms (eg 2028 or 3028 etc ).   I assume that applies to all standard rooms.  Staff and Service is pathetic at best.  Hotel safe was not working and we could not get it fixed no mater how many times we asked the front desk....plenty of yes yes right away and nothing.  Hotel is very well situated from a vista but you are a bit stranded from Tangiers. A 10-20minute cab ride.  No direct beach access.  Spa is poorly laid out...the inside pool is not heated so your out of luck in the early spring months.  Rooms are spacious for European standards and beds are comfortable.  Bathrooms are clean but still with bathtubs and a shower system that will certainly flood your bathroom floor!   Towels are a precious commodity!  We had a…,2
Over the top decor. Heaps of steps particularly to dining room.  Views but rooms too close together. Balconies are not private and you feel you are intruding on others as you can see into their bedroom.  The views from the dining room are spectacular but way way too far from wharf and downtown.  Food very ordinary.  If you like salad ok but not much mores.  Lovely pool but very cold,3
"Spent 1 night here as part of a tour. Beautiful new hotel. The decore is red and white throughout the lobby, very appropriate for us as we were there on Valentine's Day! It was an extremely windy night so unfortunately we were unable to enjoy the view of the sea. Hotel did a good job on the breakfast buffet. Would definitely stay here if in Tangier again.",4
"Spent 11 days in Morocco last year (Feb 2015). The hotel is near the beach, and not too far from the Moevenpick hotel that houses the largest casino in all of Africa :)  Beautiful hotel and great service, and the views of the beach are breathtaking. A memorable experience!",5
"Hotel is very smart , the staff are so nice the rooms are luxurious always kept very clean by a army of room maids  The restaurants are very nice so is the bar I give this hotel 5stars I will staying again The hotel is a little out of town the hotel has a car shuttle service that runs from 8am til 6pm and it's free otherwise a small taxi is only 20DH about £1.50 very cheap",5
This hotel has a lovely outlook and over the ocean and the beach and the rooms are large and comfortable.  The decor is pretty garish and the meals service was only pretty mediocre.  It was off season in Winter so I understand that it was a quiet time but I couldn't even get a coffee at the breakfast without asking for a cup and the coffee facilities to be refilled.  The room was large but the furnishings were cheap and pretty poor quality.  Out bath had burn marks all over it?,3
"I don't know who decorated this hotel but the furniture was bold red, white and black.  Check-in was fast and the breakfast buffet was good with ample selections.  The staff was always there when needed.  The room was average size for a traveling hotel room but the air condition did not work.  Several of our fellow travelers complained about the air not working.  I opened the sliding glass doors to a wonderful breeze off of the water.  The breeze cooled the room.  It just makes for a nervous night sleep with the sliders open.  There was a good view of the harbor from the back of the hotel.",3
"Unfortunately we only had one night at this beautiful hotel as we were on an intensive touring holiday travelling to Morocco by train from and to London.   However, we would not have missed this hotel for the world.   All gleaming white and scarlet in the lobby area and the room was spacious and very elegant.   We had a group dinner which was excellent served by very professional staff.   Good bar area and a very good breakfast.   Wish we had had longer here, very luxurious and would highly recommend it",5
"The hotels looks nice, although you can see easily that the quality of the construction is very ""average"" to say the least. Nevertheless the view is beautiful and the decoration is OK. We went there to prepare our next trip and booked some rooms for some friends and employees. We requested that we visit one suite before making the reservation. The receptionist told us that she would call a PR or a manager to do it. We waited 15 mins, nobody was there, No customer, everything was empty in the middle of the afternoon. After this time we went back to the reception desk and asked again whether our request was going to be honoured.. She asked us to wait a little bit more. After 20 mins more wait we left the hotel and booked elsewhere. Bad way to attract customers with a company in…",2
"Sadly we arrived late to this hotel and couldn't use the pool which looks lovely and has amazing views back to Tangier.  We ordered beer sitting on the outdoor balcony, the waitress requested that we pay cash for our drinks, would not accept credit card (despite other people in our party being able to pay that way), nor could we charge to our rooms.  As this was our last day in Morocco we had used all our dirhams, she accepted euros but refunded the change in dirhams..........!  It seemed very odd as all other hotels were happy to accept payment by credit card.  We had dinner in the restaurant that night, buffet style, lots of choices but nothing was really hot temperature wise so as a result was less than inspiring.  To top our stay, my friend was accused of not paying for a…",3
"Food is excellent, the gym equipment is the latest which includes an instructor, indoor pool, outdoor pool, superb massage facilities, buffet breakfast and stunning views. Stayed here out of season, but the weather was still warm.",4
The weirdest hotel ever! No spirit no identity no theme. You will find lots of tables and chairs scattered in corridors just left out there. Ballrooms are huge and empty  It looks & feels like a corporate convention center/hotel trying miserably to look hip and chic. FAIL,2
"The hotel itself is lovely, clean and modern. the location is a little out of the city centre, but a 5 min drive will get you there. i'm not about taxi service in the area as we had a car during our stay.  Just as other reviewers have pointed out, the booking system is rubbish and unfair. My husband booked a couple of nights for us in an executive suite as a post-wedding treat. However, upon confirming the booking on the day, he found that our room was no longer available. I'm not sure what excuse they gave at reception, but when speaking to staff members around the hotel he found that our room was taken over by Saudi royals, with bags full of cash to demand whichever room they wanted last minute. I wouldn't mind, but my husband paid for a room that he didn't receive and was not…",3
"I had booked a room at the ""5 star"" hotel as a present to my sister and her newly-wed husband for 4 nights. A week before the reservation I visited the hotel to verify the booking and was told my booking was not on the system even though i had a confirmation printed out and my money was taken out of my account. The lady behind the desk told me to come back again as they had a problem with there server. I went back again a few days later and was told that they had indeed got my reservation and to not worry about it. On the morning of the wedding, i went to check in on behalf of my sister but was told that they are overbooked and that guest where staying longer than they should but they couldn't do anything about it. There alternative was to send my sister and partner to another…",1
"The location of this hotel is superb, but unfortunately the hotel and the quality of its services is a disappointment.   The Bungalows are amazing from size and location but the finish, floor plan and amenities is a disappointment.   As for the hotel service it's just average or even below that.  It took me 4 calls and 2 visits to reception to get my AC fixed and this was done like 4 hours later   The good news my trip is short so I don't have to suffer a lot. ",2
"Stayed at the hotel for three nights the staff were very friendly, the room we had was immaculate and very spacious.  The town centre is only a short taxi ride away we would defiantly stay again.  The restaurant food was great very tasty even the children finished all their meals and we watched the most amazing sunset.  The towel boy around the pool couldn't speak a word of English but he was keen and always realised what we were looking for.",5
"We booked this hotel in April 2015 for an August 2015 trip.  We got to the hotel around 3pm.  We approached the hotel desk and before I even said my name they said that they were overbooked and that we had to move to another hotel.  Something just did not seem right, we felt duped somehow. They said they tried to contact us - I did not get any email.  I felt we were given the second class treatment because we booked with Expedia.  We had no car but thankfully our guide came back to pick us up.   IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON STAYING HERE - I WOULD DOUBLE CHECK YOUR RESERVATION.",1
"This was not what I expected from a five star hotel. None of the staff I encountered spoke sufficient English to answer my simple questions. Instead they spoke to my husband in Arabic or French completely ignoring me which was rude. The magnetic cards to open the room failed EVERY day so we had to go back down to reception to have the cards swiped. The room had a view of the sea but at a price, we were right above the (very noisy) AC outlets so we could not have the balcony door open in the evening/night. The AC in the room stank of food so I suspect it is connected to the kitchen extractor! The hotel is quite far out of town but we thought this would not be a problem as the hotel advertises a shuttle service into town. This shuttle service however this stops at 17:00 so if you…",3
"We stayed here in May and the hotel was gorgeous all around. From when you arrive to the bell men assisting with the luggage, the lobby so grand and the rooms were beautiful also, many with ocean views. The breakfast was great and the older Moroccan man, I presume he was the host was so kind - showed great hospitality, spoke good English and went into the back to get my mom espresso.  The pool deck was nice and both the French and Moroccan restaurants on property were excellent. Mom said the Cous Cous and the Rack of Lamb she had both were the best ever. This is NOT a hotel I recommend you go to if you like laying top less by t he pool drinking all day long (as we unfortunately saw at other places on our Morocco trip and often the those folks were from the same country). This…",5
"We hired a 1 bedroom villa and a 2 bedroom villa the views are amazing. The weather is hot during the day ( we were there in July) but in the evening it's lovely and cool.  The rooms and sitting rooms are spacious but I would not consider it a 5* hotel  Unfortunately I did not like the standard and finishing of the villa especially for a place that is suppose to be new.   Staff at reception were polite and helpful but found the cleaners who cleaned our room rude and not clean.  They did not empty out the rubbish bins.  Breakfast was included, the view in the Restraunt is beautiful but we did not enjoy the food. My children who are aged between 21 - 9 years old did not like the food and they are not fussy eaters.  The hotel has so much potential with the view and style of villas…",2
"Beautiful building and great hotel facilities, superb view and the location is just an easy taxi to the city. Service on the other hand... Our booking was completely wrong and took almost an hour to finally get what we needed, constantly forcing us to get more rooms As a king bed is only ""fit for one person""...????  They tried to charge us for so many extras or things we had already paid for and when we questioned it they would suddenly say oh yes yes never mind.... Weird. Oh and the highlight was pulling back my sheets when hopping into bed to find blood on the sheets. Apparently they pride themselves on their ""international standards""... Curious to know where that's acceptable...",3
The location seems to be in an upmarket residential area . The views are stunning. The rooms are well appointed with modern design and fittings . It has an extra large foyer with plenty of seating areas . Again all meat dishes should have labels at all times. Bedroom Patio areas must be cleaned before guests arrive . ,4
"The rooms were beautiful, the pool area & sunset were superb, but you have to expect that from a new hotel. The breakfast was wonderful although some items were running low especially at dinner where the meats & other items ran out completely & took a while to come out from the kitchen, staff were finding their feet & were not used to the running of a big hotel. The foya was very spectactular, the function rooms were superb & it will get better as the staff get the training.",5
We loved our stay around this hotel. The rooms were decent but the location was amazing. We were able to walk around the hotel and found a couple of nice restaurants around the area. The view from our room was nice. The pool area looked very nice and clean. The only problem my hubby had was a rude waiter but the guy was probably having a had day.   The breakfast buffet was included in our reservation and we were glad we did that. The food was pretty good.,4
"This hotel was a complete shambles in terms of management and service. It took an hour to get the luggage to the room and even then we had to search for the porter who was handling our bags  The state of the room was very poor with evidence of not being cleaned. The room safe did not work and the reception staff did not seem to have much idea of what to do to help  To cap it all, we were told to be quiet in reception as a TV crew were recording.  All we wanted to do was be sociable and talk as normal.  As much as this was disquieting, the meal served up in the restaurant at this time was of a very poor standard as was the breakfast the next morning  The whole experience was very disappointing and I could not recommend this hotel without major improvements in cleanliness,…",2
"The location, layout and facilities of this hotel are absolutely amazing. Unfortunately there were a few problems we had which were really not acceptable at this standard of hotel. At one point during our trip we both suffered from acute food poisoning which, considering it was Ramadan and we could only eat at the hotel, had to have come from the hotel food. This was an unpleasant experience but still didn't ruin our trip. The staff at the hotel were, on the whole, fantastic. The guys from reception, the restaurant staff and the drivers were all fantastic and very helpful, particularly Omar, the porter, who drove us write into the heart of the Medina and showed us where to go. There was one member of staff, however, a woman working on reception who was exceptionally rude. She…",4
"Visited at the tail end of Easter holiday and it was clear that hotel was somewhat 'wound down'.  Gorgeous views across the bay, nice interior decoration, great food, excellent spa, nice rooms (junior suite was v good value) and very friendly service. HOWEVER if they can get access to the gym consistent (it's part of a concession inside the hotel); provide some childcare facilities (there's plenty of space) and heated swimming pools this place can easily be one of the best.",4
"The stay was good but it was tarnished by the fact that the hotel had charged me twice for the reservation and absolutely refused to accept responsibility. There was a complete lack of communication before arrival and when I arrived I was told it was probably the bank's fault and to contact them, despite explaining that both the Golden Tulip head office and the hotel had both charged me individually. A few days after they refunded me with no explanation or apology.  The stay itself was quite good. The building is impressive and the breakfast was excellent. The views are fantastic. There is a free shuttle service to the city centre, but unfortunately you have to make your own way back to the hotel which is 10 minutes away from Tangier.  The room service charges seem a little…",3
I stayed couple nights there and I loved the sunset while drinking couple beers at the Terrace.... wonderful service and calm as it's a litle bit outside from the noise of the City..... I recomend it for couple days escape during winter time........,4
"We would like to thank the following staff members who made our stay so special: Asamahone (reception, concierge, highly-talented expert on all-things-Morrocan), Loubna (reception and absolutely lovely personality), Mr. Fouad (reception...funny); Hamid (breakfast), Omar (door), Khalid (driver), and many more. The maid service was quiet, sensitive to our time preferences, and of high quality. The hotel is new, with a stunning lobby that is well appointed with unique furniture and a wonderful pianist (Carlos) playing for much of the evening. The restaurant food was fantastic; authentic French and Moroccan. The breakfast experience was truly wonderful...it consists of a large buffet offering a huge assortment of delicious options and beautiful seating offering views across the…",4
This hotel is new and ultra modern. The junior suite was luxurious and spacious with a superior view. Service was good but friendliness depended on the individual encountered. Landscaping is unfinished and some things felt like the bugs hadn't yet been worked out yet.,4
For a last diner during our trip to morocco we went to the Moroccan restaurant of Hotel Farah. A bit outside the center of Tangier but still good accessible by 'petit taxi'. The lobby looked really 'wow' with high ceilings and loungy furniture (looks all new). We had a choice of two restaurants (western and Moroccan) where the western one would have had a splendid view on the bay of Tangier if we would have come during the day. So we went to the Moroccan one. A bit calm for a Saturday but I think its because of the low-season. Diner was really nice and very moderate in price if you're used to European prices. A nice local touch was the belly dancer with sitar-player/singer to help pass the time between dishes. For us it was a nice touch to end our journey.,4
We failed to realize how sleepy the town would be this time of year. The hotel was beautiful. Modern Morocco meets Europe. Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Moroccan restaurant was delicious  w/ belly dancer & live music. Bed too firm. Pillows not full. Cocktails just okay. ,4
"I was part of a delegation attending a conference at the nearby Movenpick hotel. My stay was pleasant enough...I've stayed in worse places. On the face of it, it should have been a fantastic stay but I couldn't put my finger on what it was that caused it to fall short. Until today. It was little things: promises not kept by service staff (for 4 days in a row, for the same thing, ""give us five minutes""), breakfast that is poorly put together, inconsistent supplies (one day complimentary drinking water none the next), a fruit salad that was actually a fruit platter (the room service staff were convinced ""salad"" means ""platter"")...and a myriad of other small issues that were maybe too many for a 5 star hotel over 4 nights. But I'm the patient sort and I didn't complain. Also didn't…",3
Friendly service and a beautiful hotel a very striking atrium when you enter.  Evening there is some live violin to enjoy a drink by.   Room was very spacious and comfortable - you will sleep well.  Big draw back was daily hoard/swarm of fruit flies at the breakfast - thus never really tried the later half of the buffet.  Definitely get an omelet!   The breads and pastries are awesome and you will not be disappointed.  Ocean views are terrific.  Plenty of construction in the area but never heard any noise.,4
"Everythig was good, except choices for breakfast. I found it poor for a 5 stars hotel. The room and the view were excellent. The service at the spa was good too. Our stay was too short because we w""ere invited to a wedding. I would like to redo the experience another time",4
"My family and I (11 in total) stayed here for 2 nts. We were moved here after our original choice of hotel double booked our rooms. We reserved 4 rooms at last minute. Newly opened this year. The staff were very welcoming and although there were some hiccups during our check in they responded efficiently and promptly. The staff are all very nice and go out of their way to assist u. Most of the reception staff speak English. The hotel has beautiful views of Tangiers as the hotel is set on a cliff. Business centre available. New villas/bungalows being built with private swimming pools, ideal for Muslim women wanting some privacy. Free Wifi throughout the hotel. Not very big and was not overcrowded. Would def recommend however pls bare in mind that you will  need transport. Doesn't…",5
