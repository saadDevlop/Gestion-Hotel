"I was issued a handwritten receipt of 70dh at the check in because there was no change n the drawer over my 100dh bill. The receptionist apologised and claimed that the receipt could be redeemed at check out. At check out, still no change. The receptionist advised to wait for a carrier/delivery guy to show because usually they carry cash. I requested the manager. He came shouting: All this fuss for 70dh? And they kicked me out.",4
"Check in was good and front door staff was helpful and so was the person behind the reception, got in near midnight and went to room and sleep.  Room decor is basic and room size is small and I was given a corner room so not sure how much smaller a standard room it.. I was  woken up in morning with curtains as has holes and light coming though it.   Air Conditioning was not cooling air even than I set it to the lowest and room was hot and stuffy. The fan in bathroom also didn’t work and steam from shower was heating up the room as well, so became a hot box.  I went to reception and told them and no one came to room so called down again and finally someone came up and left… I thought maybe come back but never saw him again.   Finally after 2 hours someone came up and explained the air conditioning was set to heat for the winter and tomorrow when they are in someone will change it to cool for the summer.   Breakfast was mediocre and nothing special. Went to lunch at 2.45 and nothing open apparently lunch is 12.30-2.30 and then nothing until dinner until 7.30pm, so a long wait.  I went to reception just now and waited for about 7 minutes as 2 people behind the desk were dealing with a customer and it didn’t really need 2 people but they didn’t see me so I left and went to my room.   I would expect better from an Ibis.…",3
"The Ibis Agdal is really well located - comfortable beds, great service and really, really helpful staff. Would highly recommend for business visitors. Great breakfast with plenty of choice and meeting facilities are excellent.",5
"Actually, I do like the service I was satisfied the bed was so comfortable and the towels was clean also the breakfast is so delicious and healthy the personnel’s so kind and serviable big salutation to mister Bader eddine thank you for all ",5
"I passed a great moment with my wife in Ibis hotel , a good environment a great services , especially client services we met with a professional agent her name is Narjiss Ganber , she was very kind and   helpful during our stay in the hotel .",5
Love my trip with family and family enjoyed the time and will definitely go as soon as possible once this covid-19 over to refresh mind and fresh air. Recommend to others who loves traveling different countries and location with family or friends. Love location and people are friendly and services was professional.,5
"I've been there several weeks in the last 4 months, and the staff is very nice.  The hotel is good as well, and very close to the Agdal train station.  Rooms are comfortable.  I can only complain about one details. The last week the Spanish TV  was not working and this was my only entertainment after long working days. I hope they solve it urgently, otherwise I will need to find another hotel.   ",4
"Away from the city center but nevertheless not too far (taxi are available), that hotel is convenient, clean and well maintained. Breakfast is OK, with a good choice. The restaurant is not fabulous, but as no restaurant are available is that rather residential area, it may help if you dont want to take a taxi to downtown.",4
"I stayed there for three nights, I liked the hotel breakfast it was one of best breakfast in Africa & ME for me, as general the service was great, it is in quiet area and in a good location near the train station.",5
"Stayed in late October in the hotel, it's in a good location near the train station. Breakfast is good but hard to communicate with any staff in English. You need to speak French or Arabic otherwise you would struggle to get the items you need in breakfast or other meals. Rooms are very small and hard to accommodate even a single person. Staff is very welcoming.",4
We stayed there for a few nights when visiting Rabat for a conference. The service was great. The front ladies were super helpful. The hotel also has one of the best hotel breakfast. Their bread is a must try. The only complain is that the room was quite small for two people. It would be just fine if you travel alone.,5
Found two staff at the reception since yesterday and have been extremely helpful. Both of them helped me out to stay until 6pm today due to my late flight. Soukaina & Oumaima. Lovely two ladies and everything in the hotel is just fantastic. I always stay here and I always get great service. I have also stayed here with friends and they have also always had great treatments. ,5
"I stayed in Ibis Rabat Agdal for two nights earlier this week.  The hotel is in excellent condition with a very nice lobby and facilities.  The rooms are European size (small) but it is what I expect at a budget hotel like Ibis. (I’m a diamond member with both Hilton and Marriott). The room was clean and quiet and dark.  There were not a lot of little red lights glowing in the night, a great room for sleeping.  The breakfast buffet had the best vegan options of any breakfast in the world with lots of cut fruit, fresh orange juice, almond butter and fresh cornmeal pancakes... really amazing.  I did have one issue that I expressed to the manager-  he apologized and took care of it in a very professional manner.  There is no gym,  but a great walking area outside.  Shopping nearby…",5
10 years ago I stayed in the old hotel and had a nice stay. The hotel has been rebuild recently due to the works for the new railway station. I was a nice surprise to stay for 4 days in this hotel. However as it was during the Ramadan I was a bit disappointed with the restaurant as it only offered the special Ramadan buffet and nothing else. Apart from this I really enjoyed my stay.,4
"I was organizing a conference in Ibis Hotel in Rabat. It was a very good choice in terms of the hotel (space - very good conference room; food, rooms - clean and nice, and service - very helpful and organized, flexible with our requests). The hotel is located in a great place, next to the train station. I can highly recommend this place.",5
Hotel rooms are very neat and state of the art but not too small and not big either! Loved my stay there and the hotel is  very close to the train station. Food was amazing as well and hotel staff were great! The conference room is big enough for about 70 plus people and their snacks were nice and tasty. Room service was also great. The cable also works well Thanks Ibis!!  ,5
A simple hotel with everything you might need when in business. Simple but very clean rooms with comfortable mattress and pillows. The rooms are small but space effective. Breakfast has a good selection of almost everything you might find in a city hotel. Very good croissants! Decently a place to consider when in RABAT and if you have transportation. Walking distance to the main rail station.,3
"Excellent dinner and beeter attention in the restaurant. Said was our man and he was always helping us. I recommend this hotel to stay and of course to have dinner or lunch. If you are in Rabat, don't miss it",5
Everything was great during my stay. Clean room confortable beds! The team whos working there was friendly. Food also was delicious. Nothing to complain about. Shout out to the front desk team and restaurant team. Thanks guys!,5
"Cannot say enough about this hotel! I was attracted by behavior of the restaurant staff , they were so friendly,they do absolutely everything they can to make your lunch as wonderful as possible, everything  Was very clean. The restaurants on property are amazing.",5
"Fantastic hotel, we had the most beautiful holiday, all the staff was great specially the restaurant one. I loved them for being carefull,helpful and very attentive to make you happy with their smile and their fast service It could not be more perfect. Thank you for such a great experience!",5
We stayed here for several nights while visiting Rabat.  The hotel was very nice. The morning breakfast buffet had a large selection of items to choose from.  The lounge had a good selection of alcoholic beverages including local beer and wines.,5
The staff is very nice (night teams at the top). We felt like home It is a very very good address In a neighborhood full of beautiful things close to. The hotel has been beautifully designed ! Always very comfortable The staff is very professional and very pleasant. The hotel in the afternoon and with all the other hotels in the group is a great initiative to welcome Really hat for all its benefits; a great job for the whole team for a flawless service. It's rare and it's really fun. We want to thank specially the F&B manager YOUNES he is a lovely person and professional.,5
"When you are abroad, usually you miss your family, your city, your country... So, just a team of professionals can take care of you. I had the opportunity to meet them in the Ibis Hotel Rabat! My congratulations to the Team of the Ibis Hotel Rabat!",5
"Hello,  One of the best Ibis hotel i have stayed in, very clean and well kept, friendly staff, heartwarming welcome in the restaurant specially breakfast.  Highly recommended.  Thank u so much IBIS RABAT TEAM.",5
"Good hotel with good breakfast, car parking, good room. I tried to get some information about the city but the reception employee asked to come later when I was already going out !!  the A/C is central so if need to trun on the cooling in Nov you can't,. I had to ask them to unsecure my window to open wider to get some air",3
"I have been told that the hotel was recently renovated (built anew?) and it shows. The rooms are clean, the furniture and the carpet flooring feel new. We stayed here in conjunction with a workshop that we hosted on the premises - it was very convenient for both.  Buffet breakfast, lunch, and dinners offer a great selection of food and everything was tasty. Wi Fi worked well - a big plus.  The staff were very helpful, kind, and friendly!  There is quite a bit of construction going on around the hotel at the moment (a new train station is being built). One can still get around - walk to the train station, hail a taxi, etc. But I think it will be even nicer for the hotel and its guests once construction is over. In sum, this is an excellent option for mid-price/budget hotel, and…",4
The setting is great. It is a very nice place where you can have different types of drinks BUT the service is terrible.   We sat down and the waiter took a long time to bring us the menu.then I had to take my medication and he brought a very cold bottle of water. I asked him to change it and he didn't come back. We went to the counter to ask why he didn't bring it yet and we found out that they put the bottle in some hot water to make it warmer but now it was too hot.   I honestly do not recommend it.he came back later when it was already too late to take my medicine and the bottle was too warm and the glass was broken.  I do not want to go back there again and neither should anyone. ,2
"A good quality hotel with very friendly staff. Its location is quite good and above all very economical with decent breakfast. It is close to train station, however taxis can also be arranged, which are quite cheap. I would recommend to any one looking for a budget hotel in Rabat.",4
"Nice hotel for my long stay in Rabat Morocco,  Personal staff are very helpful with a smile face and alawys in order for any request.  Rooms are very clined and organized all the time on top of that the food is delicious.",5
"5 days there in August. The hotel is newly built after the original Ibis was bulldozed to make way for a big new Rabat-Agdal train station now under construction. Everything inside the hotel is immaculate, a step up from German Ibises which were traditionally the cheap hotels for overnights next to every train station but are now being upgraded. Wifi powerful. Climate control, elevators, etc., worked fine. Good breakfast buffet. Dinner pretty good, especially salad bar. Nothing special about the neighborhood (residential and offices), but cheap small taxis (for 1-3 persons) are readily available, either flagged down while they pass by the hotel, or at the station a 5 minute walk away.",5
"The hotel is ok but what I’m really surprised and upset is that I had to request the reissue of my receipt after I stayed there, so that my company would reimburse me, and I tried to send a dozen emails along several weeks, call for several days and it was simply impossible to reach them and I never got an answer back. I also contacted Ibis but they didn’t solve my simple problem. Lousy customer care. ",1
The hotel is walking distance from the train station.  Breakfast was good.   The rooms and bathrooms were super clean.  The staff were very cooperative.   The club sandwich in the a la carte menu was great for dinner.,5
"Good location, professional staff, loved the room so cozy and comfy bad, the bathroom was clean with hot shower. The bar is quiet and nice they offered us some free tapas, they were about to close but they finally waited for us to enjoy our bottle of red wine. I used to work with Accorhotels and now i experienced staying at one of their hotels. ",5
"On arrival, reception staff were not overly friendly, but then, the next morning we saw the same reception staff on as the night before - so I'm guessing they were tired so I'll let them off!  I've never stayed in an IBIS hotel before, and to be honest, I won't be rushing back.   Our room was fine - nothing amazing but a clean large bed which was a bit hard for our taste - but you can't please everyone.   The bathroom was only just big enough really. Could have done with being slightly bigger. The shower door reached the sink nearly which made it tricky getting out of the shower.   We were on the fifth floor and couldn't work out the air conditioning to get the room at an ambient temperature. Might have been us making mistakes but this made the room very very hot by morning. We…",3
"I was surprised  by IBIS..I  realy enjoyed my stay there. my trip to rabat was for 12 nights, i have booked  only the first 5 nights. Eventually, i extended for another 7 nights, as i loved the hotel. Rooms are comfortable and clean, and staff were always helpful and friendly. wifi is super also !  I would recommend it for families, couples, and business traveler.  Great experience. Thanks to all at IBIS, and special thanks for ""Zohra"" The best house keeper  i ever dealt with in all my travels. Omar/ Jordan",5
"The hotel is pretty standard. Good position to reach the Agdal station but a bit far from the main center of the Agdal area (avenue de France). The check-in was quite slow because every guest has to fill a card with his personal and travel information, even if an online reservation has been made. This seems to be the rule in Morocco hotels, but still it could be better organized in order to save the guest's time. The room was OK, nice and modern furniture, but with sub-standard equipment: no safe was available, only one big towel and just two small doses of shower gel that were barely sufficient.  Poor experience at the bar-restaurant: very long waiting times and significantly higher prices compared to Rabat standards, definitely not worth it. The main dish (tajine) was…",2
"My girlfriend and I stayed here for one night and it more than exceeded our expectations. This Ibis felt more like staying in a luxury hotel. It's a super modern, immaculate and extremely well maintained hotel. It appears that Ibis is upgrading its brand and this hotel is a great example of the direction that the hotel is going in. The location of the hotel is good and it is next to one of the main train stations. However, Rabat is a huge city and there isn't really a central place to stay. If you are planning to stay at Ibis then expect to take taxis around the city, which is fine because taxis are incredibly cheap, there are just some traffic issues to consider. Also, the whole area around the hotel is under construction, including the train station which is being renovated.…",5
"A good place for business trip and will be a good location for travelers as the new TGV Station is being build there. Need a bit of walking to find dinning options but if you are lazy, the hotel has a restaurant and bar that serve all types of hot and cold drinks.  Room is simple and comfortable but beware to bring your own bottle of water as it is not provided by the hotel. Their laundry service is a let down, my clothes were still wet even when given to them at morning and receiving it late evening. I am an Accor member and until now the Hotel has not recorded my points.",3
I visited Rabat during Christmas it is a lovely place if you have money.But there are lots of poor people. The bed is comfortable and the room warm in winter. They had a small Christmas tree in the lobby. The breakfast was expensive and not nice. I asked for an omelette but they said no. The choice was scrambled eggs or hard boiled. Cold not warm. I found a nice Restaurant up the road it serves nice omelet’s and expresso  coffee for half the price of the hotel and so delicious. ,4
"Close to Rabat Agdal train station almost 800m walking , with a contemporary design. This new hotel is a good place if ur a passenger and want a night rest. But there’s nothing to do in the area, plus the big works they doing round make it difficult to find cabs .",3
"Stayed here for a week for a business trip. The hotel is a new one just next to the train station from where you can visit Casablanca or Agadir for instance. The room was pretty small and the air conditioner was not working. Apart from this it had everything I needed, it was clean so all together I consider this place a fair as price/value ratio stay. The kitchen is not the best neither I recommend to go to a restaurant to have breakfast to get the real Moroccan experience. ",3
"It's easy to get this hotel on foot about 5 minutes from Rabat Agdal station.  The hotel is new and nice to stay in. The breakfast was enough to energize a new day.   The staffs were very warmful, friendly, and helpful. The inside feature of thotel is as same as the IBIS hotel in Casablanca where I stayed in.  ",4
With really kind staff and lovely breakfast options and renovated rooms with excellent basic facilities you wont leave your room unless you have to ;) Its also close to the city center and travel options is well arranged from the reception.,5
"To summarise.   Receptionist not so welcoming.  Was only given 1 access card when there was 2 of us per room. We took out two rooms,  300 and 302.  Room is modern,  was clean.  window view not great,  all you can see is construction site. Windows don't stop all out side noise. Can hear trains etc. Correction window wasn't fully locked. TV channels like mbc havnt been reprogrammed so do not work. Other channels arabic work. No safe or small fridge. Room has a/c,  didn't use as room wasn't that warm at night. AC grills looked dusty,  so expect internal filters to have no bee  cleaned.  Toilet was clean,  no complimentary shower gel,  toothpaste or toothbrush. just 2 small sachet of shampoo/ conditioner and small bar of soap.  Toilet door has no lock. Doors to rooms are extremely…",3
I visited the hotel few years ago It is now in a new building because they moved few hundred meters for the construction works of the new train station  The new hotel is good and well equipped  They have good wifi tv in the rooms  Nice lobby and bar cofe with average snacks  The staff is very friendly and professional  But no frogos in the rooms It is situated far from the city: entertainment and shopping area and so on All in all it is average ,3
"I'm shocked that the Accor chain allows this hotel to bear their brand! The staff is very unprofessional. For instance the ashtrays from the night before had not been cleaned and were overflowing with cigarette butts. The sheets in my room were completely wet! There were no hand towels, no shower gel (just a tiny soap bar.) The breakfast was a disgrace: no fresh orange juice! In Morocco this is unheard of! We tried to work last night with a colleague but even inside we were attacked by flying ants... there was no A/C ok the lobby. I do not recommend this hotel at all! Their iftar is overpriced. ",1
"I stayed here with my 11 year old son on  a quick trip to Rabat. The hotel looked to have been renovated recently and was modern. The team was friendly and front desk spoke English well. Breakfast had several choices and had common Moroccan breakfast items. Our room was very small with very little space to move around. We were simply there to sleep so it was not an issue. If our stay was longer, space would have been a problem.",4
We stayed there for two nights. Rooms are nice because newly renovated. The service in general is average. Breakfast is poor. Near the railway station. I ordered chicken and the waiter decided to feed me meat.I refused so he decided to bring me a Moroccan chicken dish. He insisted.I did not like the attitude. Will never stay there again.,3
"I went the with some friends and place looks really nice after renovations ! Friendly team, best location, available parking, wok kitchen, bigggg screen for soccer lovers ! I do highly recommend this place",5
I had to stay here as part of my pre-booked Morocco adventure. This ibis hotel in unlike the others you would find elsewhere in the world. Its very basic and the rooms desperately need an upgrade. Having said that it was comfortable enough for me to use it only as a base to explore Rabat. Accommodation choices are fairly limited in Rabat so choose carefully when making your booking.,3
"I don't have many positive things to say about this hotel: - rooms were not clean, a lot of mold and mildew in the shower - if you do stay here request a room away from the street, there is ample noise at all hours of the night and on one side is a bus terminal with a lot of taxi's - breakfast was really sub-par with not much of a selection and the exact same thing every day, day after day, when staying someplace for an extended period of time this gets very boring - staff was okay but certainly not great - some English spoken but better if you speak, or are with someone who speaks, French - no elevator so you have to drag your suitcase up the stairs - rooms are average sized, bed was okay, pillows were small and hard - wifi connection was ok - there are a couple of restaurants…",2
"been here and what can i say? the last reviews are accurat. over here the staff of this hotel was extremely arrogant, arriving  realized that the hotel also doesn't have any parking, wen asked info on the reception were to park said somewhere, and wen asked were to eat just said hotel, no any other words,,not even a good evening replying to the ones we gave wen entering in the hotel. old place and noisy, with the worst breakfast i had in ibis and the worst not welcome feeling i got in Maroc",1
"Stayed here for 2 days while exploring Rabat. I'd stayed in the Fes Ibis just before and was disappointed, so feared this would be as bad. It was actually much better.  Location is good. Right next to the Rabat Agdal train station. Note: this is NOT the central train station close to the Madina, but the one further south in the ""New Town"". So it is far from all the attractions. You might need to take taxis as the nearest tram stop is quite far away. But as it is literally next to the train station there is no shortage of taxis.  Disappointingly my room was not clean. There was a lot of hair - on the floor, in the bed, in the bathroom etc. - from a previous occupant that had not been cleaned up. Other than that, things were not bad at all.  The usual Ibis facilities and design…",4
The staff was very friendly and nice. We had the room nr 228 what was absolutely quite and comfortable. We could check very early and the room was quite clean. Bathroom could be clearer and should include toalett cleaner.,3
"Difficult to have a good experience, rooms are okay... Maintenance average... Cleaning less than average... Food better than expected... Service so slowwww but with a smile ! Hope next time in Rabat... I would have a choice to go somewhere else.",3
"Don't accept any room from 134 to 141.  There's a taxi rank in the street outside: engines starting, doors slamming, people shouting at all hours.  I guess it's the same for 234 to 241.  The other side of the building overlooks a substantial garden - make sure to ask for that.  Also 134 has a generator or A7C plant or some such on the other side of the wall that made enough noise to keep me awake.  And in the adjacent railway station there are two German Shepherd guard dogs that were barking ALL NIGHT.  I was grateful for the TV because I certainly didn't get any sleep.  Ibis, you might want to rethink the legend on the door key: 'The key to wellbeing'  Not so!  And you might want to tell your people to SMILE - the young man and young girl working in reception were excellent, as…",2
"I had a comfortable room on the ground floor.  It was clean and everything in the bathroom worked.The hotel had a very nice garden at the back. The breakfast offered a choice of  a continental/ Moroccan food though it was not particularly varied, but it was adequate. The train station was close by, within sight of the hotel. For a budget hotel in Rabat it was a good choice.",4
"Stayed at the ibis rabat agdal during a quick overnight stay in rabat. Overall the rooms were of a ok size for a double. The stairways and corridor areas looked like they could do with either a good clean or makeover. Our room for some reason had a bad smell from the bathroom possibly to do with the ventilation, but as we arrived late and checked our early we didn't complain, overall staff we're ok and the hotel had a nice outdoor area. We booked the hotel due to its location close to rabat agdal train station.",3
"Very pleasant room, nice big shower with good water pressure.  The breakfast is more than adequate.  Because I was quite satisfied with the service, food and prices, I didn't even look for a restaurant. The terrace and garden areas are quiet and tranquil in spite of the fact that the train station is right next door. Depending on your reason to be in Rabat, the location may not be 100% ideal.  It was perfect for me. ",4
"Hotel rooms for smokers and non-smokers are distributed throughout the hotel, w/o any seeming rhyme or reason, resulting in smoky rooms for everyone! Please fix this problem by reserving a whole floor, or two wings, fior non-smoker rooms! Then remove the ashtrays in the hall from these non-smoker areas§",4
Good rooms. Solid breakfast with a choice of western and Moroccan food. Located near the train station which is very convenient And easy to access. Clean. Affordable. Would definitely book and go there again.                              ,4
"Right next to the train station, which appears to be a good pattern for Ibis hotels in Morocco. Much like other Ibis hotels the rooms are small and basic, and the breakfast selection is quite decent. Ordered room service as well, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food, even factoring in the room service premium.   Good to rest your head of a night, but not somewhere you would spend extended amounts of time in. There's also no lift, which means hauling luggage up a couple of flights of stairs if you're on the top (second) floor. ",3
"Located right next to the railway station the Ibis Hotel Rabat is a wonderful place to check in. Had a business meeting for 3-4 days . The rooms are soaked in an old world charm. With the walls painted blue and white, the large wooden windows open up to the lush green lawns. Food was awesome. Try the tagines. For the meeting we were pampered with constant supply of pastries and desserts. The staff were courteous . Overall no complaints",4
"I spent a week at the IBIS Moussafir Rabat. While it would have been fine for a couple of days, a week was just too long! Pros: room overlooking the garden was quiet and pleasant; hotel very conveniently located next to the Agdal train station; room clean; staff pleasant. Cons: breakfast buffet quite limited, only one coffee machine which one morning wasn't working at all, and which on other mornings had long lines in front of it; evening menu not very interesting (and half the time there was no fish); uninteresting neighborhood. Colleagues recommended the Le Piétri (reportedly in the same price range) for our next trip.",3
"The IBIS hotel in Rabat is next to the Central Railway station and the building is nice in Moroccan style, with a nice garden for siting outside. I was there on a business trip and consider myself lucky to have booked this hotel. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. (a must in Morocco).The bar was cozy and had ashtrays for smoking, where in the world can you find that nowadays. The beer was good and the free snacks very nice. The bartender and the reception staff deserve a compliment for the excellent service. The room was ok. Good internet connection.",5
"I travel extensively - on the road 75% of the time - and can say that you can do a lot better than this hotel anywhere, especially in Rabat. This Ibis does not live up to its name. Normally in a review I would list the Pros and Cons, but there are not many Pros here.  Pros: *Hmm, close to the train station? Decent croissants for breakfast? Water pressure was good? Free wifi?  Cons: *Cleanliness is in short order. Towels were dingy. There were places in my room that hadn't been swept in weeks. The tables at breakfast were not cleaned though there were many waiters standing around. Silverware and cups were dirty and the serving areas unhygienic (e.g. stains and debris in the silverware trays). *Room are tiny. I could only find a place to open my suitcase by putting it on the desk.…",1
"Ibis is located  besides the trainstation Agdal.the hotel has 2 floors and don't have a elevator. The rooms have the quality of a western Ibis,the rooms  facing the parking of station are very noisy because the taxi's sound the horn permanently. For me is impossible to stay in this rooms,I think Ibis agdal must make a reduction of 30% at least for these rooms.  The rooms facing the garden are nice and much quieter. there are a lot of trains  to rabat ville,center and costs 10 dirhams the reception is detached and i don't feel welcome.",4
"Stayed there for 3 nights. Very nice and confortable. And the cuisine is exquisite. I found the personel of the hotel very helpful. The hotel is near  a train station, which comes very handy for those who have to travel accross the country.",4
"The hotel is conveniently located near Rabat Agdal railway station. It us a very good value for money. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. Although the rooms are relatively well cleaned the hotel could have some updating especially in common areas. We found bedding (mattress, pillows and duvets) quite uncomfortable and humid. ",3
Comfortable hotel and well-priced.  I have stayed at this hotel twice. I would recommend a room on the upper floor (as opposed to the ground floor) as it is bigger and has a better view.  I liked the garden outside - peaceful and picturesque.  Minus point is that the restaurant is a little limited in selection.,4
"The room, as per Ibis, was just about functional with threadbare towels, filthy carpet but we were only staying for a stopover night. The plugs in the room didn't work to charge electronics. The phone (usually not used but we had to change around some reservations) didn't work. Wifi sucked. Close to the train station was the only plus.",3
"This hotel needs to be torn down! How can ibis allow for this ""hotel"" to be a part of Ibis? The receptionists and bar staff are rude and unhelpful. Every part of the hotel stinks of old smoke and cover up perfume. I will never ever ever return to this place. ",1
We got off at the main station only to find that there is two stations in the city and to travel into the  main part of town you can get a train for 10 drms less than a euro to the proper station . The hotel was a basic Ibis hotel with the rooms up to the standard Ibis but with large cirarette ashtrays outside in the corridor . Breakfast in hotel 59 drm less than £4 and you had a good choice of hot or cold food and the dinners were  good except for the spartan servings  which I found to be the case in other Ibis hotels,3
"I am travelling to Morocco to meet my fiancé and she recommended Ibis Rabat. I wrote them an email a week ago and nobody responded. I wrote them again twice after this and I still have not received any response. Their website does not display enough photos of the rooms and there is inadequate information about the different types of rooms and rates. My fiancé, who is Moroccan, told me that this is the standard in Morocco, which is really sad.",2
"All members of our party voted this hotel the best of our trip. It may only be an Ibis, not anything fancy, but it had a wonderfully welcoming feel to it, and the staff were very helpful. Great location, and the Guardien parked us right outside. Being next to the station, it was easy to get a taxi to go around the city. Our room overlooked the beautiful garden. We ate in the restaurant which was very nice, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Rabat. It has a real authentic Moroccan feeling, without sacrificing any of the comforts you would expect. We did have a wry smile about the wonky light switches though ;-) Maybe next time we will take them a spirit level as a present!",5
"Hotel is a little out of town but connections are easy and frequent via taxi, tram or train.  Rooms facing the courtyard are significantly quieter than those facing the station square, though it was not overly noisy, despite the busy area.  Rooms could benefit from an update, aspects are looking a bit tired, but it was clean, safe and comfortable - exactly what you would expect from Ibis.",3
"The only thing missing was thicker towels. The location is really great. Right next door is the train station and you can have a coffee or lunch there at super low cost. I really liked the reception and it was a super safe location. It does not have a pool but the garden is really lovely and if you have to eat at the hotel, the food is lovely. Good strong wi fi. I actually really liked this hotel alot. I would definitely recommend it as a good safe clean stay",5
"It's a good base for a meeting, very nice garden but missing a pool...good breakfast, food also ok, but not special. Rooms comfortable but missing the little bit extra, but a safe and relaxing hotel if a short business stay!",3
"The ibis Rabat is on a good location close to the railway station and ideal for train-travellers like us. The rooms including the bath are clean, the bed comfortable and the climatisation works good. Also breakfast and the work at check-in-desk was o.k.       ",4
"I stayed at Ibis Rabat for 3 nights with over 30 others because of a wedding weekend. I was horrified to discover that I slept with ants not only on my room side board table but also in my bed and asked to be moved which Driss Nahid (Deputy Manager) did as requested the next day.  I was assured that there will be no ants in my new room after the inconvenience that I had to pack and unpack and sure enough, I discovered ants again in the 2nd room. I was then moved again and unfortunately I had no choice but to stay for another night with the wedding guests on the 3rd night but fortunately the room was ant free. I regretted staying at this Ibis. The manager agreed to refund my 1st night but as expected this had not been received. He refused to refund me for the other nights even…",1
"stayed there for a night, the service was soo poor during breakfast, there is a lady there who thinks she owns the restaurant and treating people in a very rude way. you must put some efforts into training your staff.... it would help you serve better",2
First time was in June 28th 2014 and wasn't happy at all. Poor service and room was totally uncomfortable . However went again in July 29th 2014 and service was much better and there is a gentleman with the name of Zakaria on reception desk he was very helpful,3
"An Ibis-Hotel as usual. So far nothing special, because you know what you get.  But the reception was really very friendly, specially the young man in the late shift was  absolutely wonderful. He arranged airport shuttle for me and helped me a lot. ",3
"Stayed 2 nights. Stayed at many Accor hotels and experienced lower standards in morocco, location was good, but  hotel Employees at reception desk were rude. No elevator need to take stairs, Room was almost the general IBIS standard (can't complain) however, the bathroom was worn down and the toilet seat was broken which they fixed, had 1 soap & 2 Sachs shampoo hardly enough for one person. Breakfast had few choices and food was not great but the sitting area outside was very nice (go to nearby restaurants). Gave them my loyalty card at check-in they said they registered it but discovered that they haven't done so. There are better hotels in Rabat. Would not stay at this location again.",2
"My stay was great. I had a 4day meeting there. The room was good even if the bathroom floor wasn't clean enough...apart from that, the staff was very efficient (especially the waiters and waitress) and they did everything they could to please us. The garden is really nice and it was nice having our meals there. As a vegetarian I was afraid meals would be boring but for 4 days we had different and tasty vegetarian meals. We also use the conference rooms and coffee breaks and everything was clean and good. ",5
Ibis hotel is very convenient near the railway station.It is go come by rail or bus from Casablanca and then use the blue taxi to go around town. The room is clean with enough towels . The breakfast is copious for 5 euros. The gentleman at the reception was very helpful. I was impressed how meticulous about safety.The rate was fair in view of the week celebration taking place in Rabat and the cost of hotels were prohibitive. I paid 63 euros.              ,5
"The Ibis is ok for a short stay provided you are not sharing a room. The very comfortable but very large bed takes up most of the available space. To move from the window to the bathroom means inching your way between the bed and the closet or crawling across the bed. I chose the latter. Toiletries (one small bar of soap and two shampoos) and towels are adequate for one but not two guests. There is no usable workspace. Breakfast is only average and I recommend skipping the restaurant's other meals. There are many restaurants in walking distance - go out of the hotel, turn left and go to the end of the road. Turn right and you are on one of the area's busiest streets. Service at check-in was polite, but service in the restaurant and bar is awful. It is very hard to get a server's…",3
"I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights.  1-staff : I could tell that they have never been trained or maybe they are not bothered to give effort . I booked this hotel through thomas cook in uk . When im checking out they spent like 30 min checking my booking so how they let me on on the first place. Simply they have no clue !. Plus they don't know how to show respect 2-the restuarent :  poor  3- room: clean. Toilet : why they provide only one small soap and two small sachet shampoo for a room for couple ! Expecting us to have one time shower aday!  3- why I rated average ? Because the location and the clean room but for the money I paid I can find better hotel for sure so I don't think om going back again to it  Ibiz management :please send someone their for unexpected visit , this…",3
"Perhaps a good location close to train station, but otherwise not much going for it.   Compared with other IBIS hotels I've stayed in, the service is rubbish to non-existent.  Upon arrival, it felt like I was inconveniencing the staff at reception by showing up.  Bed is clean and comfortable and AC is blissfully quiet, but room is tiny, bathroom is grubby, there is no drinking water provided, no kettle or tea in room, not even a box of facial tissues, and shampoo comes in little tearable (pun intended) sachets that you'd more likely find in a budget hostel.   And of course no elevator.    The restaurant is to be avoided.  It was a mistake to decide to avoid the walk to nearby restaurants and go there.  I waited ages for a filet de sole meuniere that ended up being little more…",1
"Hotel close to the town centre and nearby to the train station. Easy to obtain taxis.  Large open air carpark next to the hotel, price very cheap. Hotel itself - No lift which means carrying baggage up a narrow spiral stairs.  Room small but clean. OK for an overnight stay. Restaurant decor seem like a works canteen.  Breakfast OK however, supplies need continually stocking up, the client should not need to ask. Would stay again.",3
"I spent two nights in the Hotel. I was first surprised when I have been told that there were no lift in the hotel. The room was small but calm with a nice view on the garden. The bed was comfortable, but the shower was ugly and looks really dirty. Honestly, I did not expect such low quality for an IBIS hotel, famous for the high quality meeting the expectations of tough customers.",3
Generally disappointing. There is no lift in the hotel so you have to carry your luggage up the awkward staircase. My room had one damp wall - it was wet when I touched it. No drinking water provided in the room and no tea or coffee making facilities. I found the opening and closing hours of the restaurant inconvenient - no possibility of having dinner before 7.30pm. Despite the extravagant claims on the brochure in the room the breakfast buffet is very basic - the only cooked dish available on each of the three mornings I stayed there was watery scrambled egg. The staircase carpet was dirty when I arrived and stayed like that for three days.,2
"I read the previous reviews but booked despite the negative comments.  Arrived in anticipation of a bad hotel but i was pleasantly surprised.  Not sure if it was because I had really low expectation that whatever I got would have exceeded my low expectation...  It was an Ibis so i expected a basic budget hotel which it ticks all the boxes too.  Not sure if the previous reviewers expected a lot more but this is an Ibis at the end of the day so expect an ibis experience.  On plus side Clean room, not too noisy, basic but plentiful breakfast and efficient staff.  Location excellent as next door to railway station though we arrived by car so didn't take advantage of this  On negative side Room had a bit of condensation issue (windows dripping first thing in the morning) and no lift…",4
"the carpets on the stairs and hallways looked dirty.  the hallway leading to the room had a weird smell and is not something refreshing.    room was adequate  with  a great view of the garden, shower is small but comfortable. lacking of toothpaste and soaps.  we  occupied a double room but they only put  1 pc. of soap and  2 sachets of shampoo.  the lady at the counter was not  wearing  presentable uniform, saw her wearing slippers and was not smiling at all. the tone of her voice was not friendly, sounding like she was interrogating.",3
"Nice, European like hotel. Next to the Rabat Agdal station and some 25 mins walk to the center of Rabat. Nice staff and clean rooms. Good base to go and visit other cities and to go south of Rabat to beaches.",4
"This hotel offered good comfortable beds 2 x's; upon arrival after Trans Atlantic + connecting flight into Rabat & before leaving to return home, after our group holiday tour of southern Morocco. The rooms are a little cramped for luggage for 2 (twin room) but the shower was large & good hot water. There was some evening voices noise from the terrace but okay when window shut & AC was in good working order. I noticed some tiny ants on the desk on the 2nd visit. The buffet breakfast was very full with choices of breads & pastries, toast, jams, olives, cold cuts, scrambled eggs, fresh squeezed OJ, cold cereal, fruits, choice of coffees & tea  They accommodated our need for 5am breakfast before flight departure with much of above buffet, cereal, pastries, hard boiled eggs, fresh…",4
"This might be good value for a one star hotel, but absolutely terrible for a 3 star hotel. carpet is very old and not clean, hallways don't seem to have been painted or cleaned in ages, cheap soap, no iron in the room,  rooms had bad odor, rooms are too small. staff were friendly but failed to follow up on my request. i would not recommend this to anyone, but unfortunately, luck of choices of better hotels in Rabat, make this one a better option",1
"It is a very simple, and small hotel. Next to the Rabat Agdal railway station, which makes access to other towns like Fes and Marrakesh is  easy by train. Taxis are also accessible just outside the hotel. But do not expect a mini bar or other facilities that you can find in a five stars.  Groceries stores are nearby, at a walking distant you can find a small Carrefour. But if you want to go shopping, the Medinah is about 15 minutes taxi drive at the cost of about Moroccan Dirhams 20.  The staff of the hotel is not too friendly, but they are also not rude. Do not expect greetings from them, they will just let you pass by ignored. If you ask directions, they may help you out. But if you want to make small changes in order to pay for the taxis, they will say that they do not  do…",3
"After a difficult drive in strong winds and torrential rain from Tanger Mad ferry terminal, it was a delight to arrive at the guarded car park with plenty of spaces next to the hotel.  The hotel was immaculate and quiet; the staff very helpful if sometimes a little aloof.  A small problem with the bill was quickly and politely reolved.  The hotel is in a good area and well served by an abundance of inexpensive taxis at the nearby station.  Not delux but well up the IBIS standard. We'd certainly stay again.",4
