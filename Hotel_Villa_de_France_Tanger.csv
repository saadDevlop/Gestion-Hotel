review,rating
Beautiful hotel in the middle of the best part of Tangiers for seeing the sights. The French influence is in every pore. Mainly French guests which was good for me as l can just about make myself understood. The staff were amazing. Highly recommended. Just don't drink in the bar. The prices were seriously taking the P.,4
"A very elegant hotel with lovely decor. Boutique hotel with nice view of the sea. Though not all rooms get a good view. Rooms are small, about 14 by 14 ft, but comfortable. Decent sized bathroom. The rare hotel which has place to put up 2 large bags, though the bag rack takes up space in front of the cupboards. There is no coffee or tea making facilities in the room and the wifi didn't work while we were there. They did not have drinking glasses in the room. But if you can live without the above, then a lovely place to stay.   It has a nice terrace on the ground floor.  Buffet breakfast has a reasonable choice.",4
An historic building .. clean and spacious rooms. Ours had a view over the garden terrace.  All the people working in the hotel were helpful and friendly .. a lovely lady who was cleaning suggested I use the service lift rather than wait for the other lift. Very kind although I ended up in the kitchen 😬 We asked to see the room Matisse painted from  .. number 35. You can stay in the room too I think. A lovely gift for Art lovers.  Easy to get around from here too.  The hotel in on an incline so there are steep slopes and steps to access reception. We arrived very early on the overnight sleeper from Marrakech and they happily let us check in early.  Thoroughly enjoyed our overnight stay and breakfast was super .. lots of beautifully prepared fresh fruit.  Would highly recommend.,5
"This vintage hotel is ideally located on the periphery of the old medina and near the Port. It’s been well -maintained and offers terrace views, piano bar, breakfast room and on-site restaurant. Rooms are comfy but not what you would considered modernized. The breakfast has ample choice but the service was slow. There were a couple of issues with the front desk, and the staff doesn’t appear to be coordinated. Overall the location and the old charm of the property made up for its short-comings.",4
"The hotel is beautifully furnished and decorated.  Many references to Henri Matisse, who stayed here in the early 20th century.  My room was large and overlooked the sea.  Service was excellent at the front desk and in the bar.    the location is super, being just on the edge of the medina and a few blocks from the center of the new city.    I only had breakfast and it was very nice: lots of fresh fruit and cheese and meats.  French pastries.  Excellent coffee.  The desk man is very helpful and engaged a guide for me so I could have a fast tour of the medina and the outskirts of town.  I will stay here when I visit Tangier again, I hope in 2021.",5
"We had severe problems finding someone in the staff who could provide pool towels. Apart from this, we found the hotel great! The pool area is nice (although parasols were a bit past their glory days), and one of the neighbouring hotels has, in fact, a picture of THIS hotel’s pool area as a THEIR ‘view from hotel room’. We walked from the ferry to the hotel, no need for taxi unless you have large suitcases.",4
"How I wanted to see the room where Matisse had painted Window at Tangier so we went up the steps of The Grand, fully expecting it to be occupied. Instead a charming young man took us up to the second floor and unlocked room 35 with the original key. From the window you can look down on St Andrews church, over the bay and across to the mosque on the far hillside. Exactly as Matisse had painted it over 100 years ago. Except the trees have grown to hide the church. The original painting no doubt worth millions is in Russia but a copy with its bright blue edges hangs over the rather small and hard looking bed. From the other window more views of Matisse’s work. Best part of my holiday in Tangier. Well done Grand Hotel!",5
"We selected to stay here as a last night before taking the ferry to go back to Spain. The hotel is outside of the Medina, easier in and out by car We were given a room in the ""old part of the hotel"" Thank God it was one night, the first room we received the bathroom smelled to urine and sewer. Then we asked for a change of rooms, that as granted by the very nice man in the reception. The new room same  part of the hotel had no smell, but mini-refrigerator was leaking water, we called, they cleaned it and next morning another pool of water, we did not care just for one night. Bathroom is falling apart pieces are falling in the shower. We ate in the restaurant that was nice though. Very nice, for Morocco prize expensive, for US price a bargain. We were given a quick breakfast since we left at 6:30 in the morning, that was very nice. All in all I think they promote this as a 5 star hotel, probably 3 because of the restaurant and the pool  that are nice. For the rooms, this is a 2 star hotel I would try to look for another property in Tangier…",3
We used this hotel just to crash for a night and regretted it later because the hotel is at a beautiful location and has great views. The hotel is dated and should get an overhaul but I guess the dated look and feel adds to the old world charm. The room was comfortable. The staff was very helpful. ,4
"Loved this hotel, don't expect modern decor, as old and original. Rooms not huge but comfortable, breakfast adequate, outside garden area great for pre dinner drinks. Set in side of hill, lovely view. Easy walk to market and shops.",5
I loved everything about this hotel with the exception of the bathroom. The drainage was a problem from the very first day. They sent someone but the sink never worked. It is disappointing to stay in such a high quality hotel and not be able to brush your teeth properly.,4
"Old style hotel, well renovated, perched on top of the hill with an excellent view - the walk up the front steps was good exercise!  Good service, great bar, rooms as shown - would stay again if I am back in Tangier",5
"This place is absolutely gorgeous! I felt like we were on a movie set. The views of the city were amazing. The rooms were just as shown on the website, very clean and beautifully decorated.  The staff were always helpful and accomodating. Mourad ( spelling?) the concierge took care of our every request and the bartender, Youseff not only took great care of us but was a wealth of information about the country and the culture.  We hope to go back someday and will definately stay here!",5
"Bad management, processed wrong date, cannot modify it.  TWO thumbs DOWN!   Due to booking website has issue about wrong check in date, the agency called them to modify but the manager was insisting they cannot make any change even the booking was made late night which is not sense and it’s a very clear mistake.  It’s very upset experience😫",1
"If you must go to Tangier, do everything to avoid your stay at this hotel.   DO NOT get a tour from the front desk - tour is laced with kickbacks from local vendors. Was told we were going to be given a taxi ride to a local restaurant with a 2 hour walking tour for EUR 25 - turns out the 'walking tour' was a tour to walk to three vendors in which we were swindled to buy worthless goods. At the conclusion of our tour we made a payment to the tour guide of EUR 42 to cover the tour, tip, and taxi fare. A day later we were hostilly approached by the bellman OF THE HOTEL saying we never paid the taxi - even though it was made clear that it was included in our tour payment! Very 'randomly', as we were being ambushed to make this EUR 7 payment, the taxi driver 'randomly' appeared…",1
"I booked this hotel hoping for a stay in an old grand hotel. Well it was old and possibly once grand. I had booked a duplex and when we entered the room it smelt terrible. Similar to sewerage. I told the front desk and he said the hotel was full. He told me all the duplex rooms had a smell.  He did show me another room but it was small and had twin beds. As I’d pre paid through hotels.com I couldn’t move hotels. Finally he showed me another duplex room, which didn’t smell a lot. The bathroom was tiny and the furniture old and hard to sit on. Being right by the pool it was noisy from children playing. The next day the room director changed us to a larger room at the front of the hotel. Whilst being a good size it was in poor condition. The timber floors hadn’t seen a polisher in…",1
"My son and I stayed here for four nights whilst visiting Tangier. Everything was amazing; the staff, the rooms, gardens, pool areas, restaurants and bars.  Luxury on a grand scale, what more can I say!!",5
"This hotel probably used to be a 5 star hotel when it was first built, but now it’s kind of run down and dirty. The towels in our room were threadbare and falling apart. We also found hairs and a stain in our bed. The breakfast was lovely though and it was served in a beautiful open air courtyard. The pool area is nice as well. The staff weren’t overly friendly. Overall, it was ok. ",3
Had a very pleasant stay. The hotel is elegant and rooms are five star from times gone by. If you manage your expectations then don’t expect global standards. This is Tangiers and the hotel gives a Bohemian air.  The pool area is very nice and it was nice to relax in an oasis of calm. Médina is five minutes walk and the Kasbah 10-15 mins. Hotel has a great terrace for drinks. Breakfast was varied and plentiful. Staff are helpful although you have to ask for what you want.,5
"The Grand  is a beautiful hotel, located at the top of a hill and a short walk down to the medina. Great views. Architechturally this is a n impressive grand old house that has has been well maintained  and stocked with some lovely antique furnishings.  Elegant dining room. Lovely chandeliers. Bedrooms are well proportioned and furnished well. Marbled bathrooms a little dated but good shower over tub. Staff were ok but did not deliver a 5 star experience. Breakfast was also lacking for a 5 star hotel. ",4
Only stayed at this hotel for one night and from the outside on arrival I went this place looks amazing but from then on it was like “faulty towers”. The room was small but well set out.   The main reason for giving this hotel such a poor rating was the rude staff especially the waiting staff. The man attending to the tables from the outset was rude and not willing to listen to what was being asked of the clients. A glass of wine for 5€ should be a full glass not a half glass. I hope the staff in the future are better trained as the hotel has a great history but will be lost quickly with its current staffing and management.   Time not for it to improve as the area has many other options regarding accommodation. ,1
"I only had one night in this hotel, as I was boarding the ferry the next morning to Spain, but I really wish I could have stayed longer. The hotel is on a hill with a wonderful view of the city and of the ocean. Originally built in 1880, this gorgeous old hotel has been beautifully restored. The staff is really nice and helpful, and they all spoke English (which I needed)—and also Arabic, Spanish, and French. The room was spacious, comfortable, and really beautifully designed. I had a wonderful view of the courtyard below (a great place for drinks or a meal if it's not too windy), and it was nice and quiet. I was able to just walk down the hill to the Medina and explore the city, and, being a walking person, I loved that.  I really loved this hotel and hope to get back to it…",5
Cute hotel located close to the ferry terminal in Tangier.  Old hotel which has been renovated.  We stayed here with a large group and everyone complained that the air-conditioning did not work.  Food at the breakfast buffet was good.  Interesting history with Matisse as a former guest.  Ask to see his room and art collection.,4
"It's a nice hotel, but the staff is unfriendly and treated us badly. Nice pool area, nice rooms, good view. It's located in the centre of Tanger. The staff refused my Moroccan friend to stay in the hotel.",2
"Nice hotel but past it's prime and definitely not 5 star.  The amenities are getting old and some are in other ""sister"" hotels so don't expect them there. Breakfast is ordinary - nothing to write home about. Great views and close to port but service is slow and prices are high.",3
"Karim was an amazing host during our stay at the Grand Hotel. We were at the tail end of a three-week trip and we couldn't believe the oasis we stepped into. Our room was spectacular. Just a short step from our patio to a beautiful pool. From the upstairs balcony, the views were amazing.   Karim provided great support for our visit. Arranging some excellent tours, helping us get some medicine, and making great recommendations for enjoying the city.  We also very much enjoyed the hotel restaurant and lounge. The Grand Hotel provided an experience that we'll talk about for many years to come.",5
This hotel is in a dump of a neighborhood and is so old how could it be a 5 star hotel? They need to fix this. It was for sure a 2 star. The breakfast was the worst we have had and the rooms were weird. They didn’t have hand towels and when we asked for some they brought up old with holes regular shower towels. The keys never worked and each time you had to go down to get it fixed. The sheets were like sandpaper and the room refrigerator was locked. So we had to call to get it unlocked just to put our pizza in it. That was weird. Then we had our room cleaned and they didn’t refill the toilet paper. It was too late at night to get a new one so we were stuck with no toilet paper for a night. That was ridiculous. The couch was the most uncomfortable and the pillows were detached…,1
"We found this European type hotel very nice.  We stayed across the hall from the room Matisse stayed in and painted his ""Room With a View""  The hotel is very proud of this and keeps the room just as it was.  It is in a great location to be a part of all the action in the markets.  The hotel restaurant is excellent and very elegant as is the service.  This hotel is really good find!  Stay and enjoy it!!",5
"We spent one night at the Grand Hotel Villa de France during a recent trip to Morocco.  Our experience was just average.  From the outside, the hotel is exquisite.  Sitting up on a hill, it has a nice view from the top.  It a 5 Star hotel.  The staff was very cordial, friendly and helpful.  Our room was small, the temperature was difficult to control, there were only a few electrical outlets placed in awkward locations and our view was of a roof. The room did have a refrigerator, a safe and wifi.  The water pressure in the shower was good but difficult to control.  The hotel provided the two very luxurious robes for our use.    Our dinner in the elegant dining room was enjoyable.  Portion size was small and we had the feeling the staff was rushing us to finish our meal. Maybe…",3
I spent 4 nights at this hotel and it was a great decision. It is a jewel in a beautiful city. It cost 40 dirham from train station. The staff are very attentive and the property is in great condition. Pool was clean and the lounge chairs very comfortable. It has an awesome piano bar with fabulous views of Medina which is 3 minutes walk away. Rooms are very spacious and room 407 had an incredible view.,5
Charming hotel remodernised some years ago. We were very lucky to be taken around the building by a very nice young man.  He showed us the old entrance to  and the famous Henri Matisse roo. Where he stated and painted pictures as seen in the room to day of views from his window. The roof top is fun to watch the coming and goings of markets and amazing street noise. The food and service  in the restaurant was up market and good choice of wine and food. There are 2 bars to relax in. Our room was tastefully furnished with charming views too. I would certainly choose this hotel again ,5
"Charming older hotel; room was well appointed with nice sitting area and lovely view of the ocean. We ate lunch on the patio, food and service were good. The Medina is very close by, but a bit difficult to navigate. The hotel doesn’t provide a city map or brochures on points of interest.   One cautionary note, if you want a guided tour of the city don’t go through the hotel. Having only one full day in Tangier we had the hotel arrange a driving tour with an English speaking driver.  Our driver was quite pleasant, but arrived an hour late and spoke very little English. He wasn’t able to give us any history of the city, couldn’t explain what he was showing us, and we never saw a glimpse of the Kasbah.",4
We stayed 2 nights at this hotel and were very happy with everything. It is about 20 minutes walk (along the outside of the medina) from the port. The location is great for visiting the sights in the medina. The tourist office is in the more modern area of city and were very helpful. We walked to the bus station which was 45mins downhill.  The hotel staff were really helpful with our questions. We changed our money at the hotel and rate was reasonable. The facilities were nice. The room was very spacious and soundproof (though you will hear the call to prayer). Only thing that would have made things even better is a welcome morrocan tea as it is a 5 star hotel. ,4
"This is a really nice hotel for Tangier right next to the Medina.   It is set on a hill behind walls with great views of the Mediterranean  from many of the rooms.  The Duplex rooms set at the back of the property next to the pool are a great choice.  #4 is on the end with great views from the patio, living room and upstairs bedroom.  Staff is accommodating and helpful.  Restaurant is just okay.  It was too cool when we were there, but there is a patio restaurant that looks lovely.  I think the El MInzah is a more famous hotel given all the celebrity pictures, but the Villa de France is certainly on par with any hotel that we saw.  ",4
"We had anticipated our stay here on the last night of a seven day tour of Morocco based upon others' reviews.  The exterior of the property exudes charm (age) and dignity but the illusion was quickly dispelled.    The hallway to our room was carpeted but was covered with loose dirt, lint, and who knows what else.  It didn't look to have been vacuumed in weeks or longer.  Upon entering our room we were overwhelmed by the smell of sewage.  We traced the source to the shower drain so we used the bath mat to cover the drain for the duration of our stay.    The room was furnished with dated and minimal pieces.  We tried to sit on the bed to watch TV but the TV didn't work and the bed slid away from the headboard immediately.  We were adjacent to a service well between buildings where…",1
"We booked our room here through Cancelon, which was an option on Tripadvisor. We paid and received a confirmation, so we thought that we were all set. We arrived a couple hours early with confirmation in hand to find out that this third party booking agency had not secured us a room here. The reception manager took care of everything for us. He got us a refund and secured us a better rom than we had booked for a little bit less than we had originally paid. They ensured that this incredibly stressful situation was defused, and went above and beyond in every way our entire stay.   We booked a guided tour of the Old Medina and Kasbah through them, which I would definitely recommend. This hotel is located perfectly for the best sightseeing itinerary. They served us complementary…",5
"  My first night in Morocco was spent in this very nice hotel.  It is an older facility but has been kept up very well.  Staff most accommodating.  Room was a very nice size and the bathroom quite adequate.  One suggestion about room location: unless you like hearing Moroccan music late into the night, ask for a room which is not located just above the dining room.  Music is played there during dinner hour which runs to about 11 PM.    I had dinner in the dining room and it was quite nice.  Breakfast is served in another room and food selection was good.  They make Moroccan ""pancakes"" as you wait.   The hotel is proud of its history, especially the fact that the artist Matisse spent a number of years in the hotel.  They will gladly take you to the room he and his wife stayed in…",5
"this used to be someone's villa and now is a hotel.  the rooming number and lift is a challenge but you will get used to it after a while.  the rooms are old but clean and spacious.  it is high up on a hill and you get a lovely view of the sea. it is also walking distance to the market and to get a cheap bite. lots of black/white photos along its walk way showing the place and it is quite unique.   as we were part of a tour group and one morning we had to have a very early start, the waiter isn't a morning person and he was a bit grumpy but other than that, the place is just showing old charm.",5
"We only stayed at this hotel for one evening, but we felt completely taken care of the whole time. We were traveling to Marrakesh the next day, and had not yet booked our train tickets. The hotel concierges and bellhop were incredibly helpful and helped us search tickets for airplanes, which they said would be similar price and cut down dramatically in the travel time. Since we would be leaving at the crack of Don, they also arrange for us to have breakfast delivered at 5 AM as well as arrange for a taxi in the early morning. We were so appreciative of their help in coordinating our itinerary. We stayed in the Villa which was overlooking the pool and had a view of the Mediterranean, and it was incredibly beautiful. All of the amenities were in great quality. We actually wish we…",5
"We have stayed in Tangier many times in several different hotels but this one is by far the best. Large, stylish and comfortable bedrooms with decent bath facilities. Great breakfast and a large separate Eden dining room serving a good choice of local food and wine. The hotel has two good bars.   The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The hotel is very well located near the Kasbah and a good walk down the hill to the bay. There were good outdoor areas and a nice looking pool. Too cold for us to use in February but we will certainly be back later in the year.",5
"We arrived early and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and even got us a room early and, at that, they upgraded us to a nicer room with a view.  Later in the day, they even delivered a wonderful fruit basket to our room which came in handy come dinner time (keep reading).  The location is perfect with easy access to the Medina.  Great selection at breakfast.  Our only complaint was that the restaurant for dinner was fine dining only and it didn't open until 7:30p.  Not many options for vegetarians either so, keep that in mind if this would effect you.",4
"This is a classy and old school hotel with great service and staff for a great price. Location was good too and included free parking. The room we had was spacious, clean and quiet. There was extensive variety at breakfast with great service - they served the best Moroccan pancakes along with so much more. The terraces were beautiful. We enjoyed our short stay here and would recommend this hotel.",5
"This one of the older hotels that really gives you a sense of what the heyday of the 30s, 40s & 50's must have been like.  It has been updated with modern plumbing and outlets and such. The lobby bar and piano bars were nice and cozy, although we only popped into the piano to look around and only had one drink at the lobby bar.  The Duplex Suites are where you want to stay.  There are only 6 so book early.  I did not see any of the actual rooms in the main part of the hotel, but was told they were all recently updated. The duplexes are 2 story villas that overlook the pool, each with a private 2nd story balcony off the bedroom overlooking the pool and a large private patio of the living room that goes directly out to the pool.  It feels like you are staying at an authentic…",4
"After walking through the hustle and bustle of the medina and the souk, tea (or wine) in the lounge of the hotel settles your nerves. Well situated in a lovely park setting, the recently renovated hotel is on the boundary between modern and traditional Tangier. The staff is helpful and friendly, breakfast is varied and plentiful, the Moroccan dinner is a treat. Ask for a sea view room and ask to visit room 35 where Henri Matisse painted his masterpieces of Saint Andrew church (currently in the Pushkin museum in Moscow) and Tangier life. A great place from which to explore! ",5
"A fabulous and beautiful hotel. Five star ammentities and service for a great price. We loved staying here and certainly will stay again. Thanks to all the staff for a great experience, including the help getting to the port and for excellent breakfast service.",5
"From the moment we arrived from the ferry until we left after two nights, we enjoyed excellent service. When our prescription glasses broke, reception took the frames to have them repaired. When we needed directions, someone came with us to show us the way. Breakfast room and dining room as well as living room area off the reception all served excellent food and drinks with personal touches. We loved being treated to this level of care, resulting in a very pleasant stay.",5
"The hotel is located in the city centre and is 5 mins walk to Medina. It is surrounded by wall and with big garden and pool, which isolated the hotel from the crowded city. The building itself is charming, I felt like back to the 1940 in TV movie. Staffs are polite and can speak fluent english.",5
"The hotel is very nice, food staff excellent! It would be a five if it wasn't for one man who greeted us as we entered. Unfortunately we did not get his name. This man was trying to get every penny he could squeeze out of us. He was constantly asking us where we want to go. If it was a bite to eat he would tell us a person will show you where to go for a couple of Euros. The bank, again a person would show us for a couple of Euros. When we first arrived he wrote down two places to eat, you guessed it, someone can show you for a couple of Euros. We looked up reviews for the restaurants and found that they were the restaurants that tour guides bring you to that pay the guides commission.  We found our own taxi to drive us to Chefchaouen. When he came to pick us up this same man…",4
"We've been around, stayed in many hotels, in many countries but the degree of friendliness of ALL personnel in this hotel is unsurpassable, from the front desk clerks, the maître d' and waiters in the breakfast room, the dining room personnel, to the wonderful chambermaid. We deliberately chose an authentic hotel versus international chain hotel, and authentic it was: on top of a hill overlooking the Socco Grande, built around a central blue-tiled courtyard, an old-time beautiful dining room with sparkling chandeliers, artfully carved room doors & ceilings. The food is superb (think lambTajine!!!), the breakfast buffet plenty, varied and fresh and not to forget: the ever-served mint tea. As mentioned above: un-for-get-table!!",5
"A charming building overlooking the medina, within easy walking distance of the casbah and harbor. Has fabulous views from its roof terrace. The building dates from the early 20th century, but the rooms are well-appointed, comfortable, large, and with excellent wifi. Hall walls have scores of fascinating photos of Tangiers. Breakfast was superb. Attractive garden, pool, and patios. I can't imagine a better place to stay if one wishes to experience today's Tangiers and also taste something of Tangiers during its heyday.",5
"We are from California and stayed for three nights at this Hotel from an excursion from Spain and loved it!  The staff and management were all very welcoming, friendly, and helpful at every moment of our stay. They upgraded one of our rooms for my teenage daughter who is an artist to stay in the Matisse room, a very special room with the most spectacular views and history related to the artist.  The Hotel arranged for a guide to help us tour the city and surrounding areas. If you stay at the Grand Hotel or the sister hotel El Minzah, equally beautiful and charming and where we stayed our last trip, you must ask for the guide Youssef. He is a wonderful guide, speaks many languages and knows everyone in Tangier. Youssef made us feel safe the first time we came to Tangier with our…",5
"I am writing to follow up my wife's review of our stay on this hotel and on their outstanding service on recovering and mailing back a jacket we forgot there.  The hotel shipped the jacket back to the US by DHL, charging it to our credit card with no major incidence, and we have received it.  A big thanks to an outstanding concierge and front desk team who found the jacket a week after our stay, kept it, inquired about DHL fares to mail it to different addresses, put together the package, sent it and kept us updated on the whole process.  A big thanks to them and to the manager that answer our first Tripadvisor posting on this.  This indeed makes this a first class hotel in every sense.",5
"My husband and I, and my mother stayed at this hotel on Nov 30th, rooms 317 and 318. The view from the room was great and the room itself well appointed, clean and with all amenities.  A basket with fruit was waiting for us in the room.  There was bottled water in the room free of charge.  We were received well and helped with luggage and our car was stored in their great garage.  The front office was efficient and cordial, although we were not offered tea at check-in. We ate in the hotel beautifully decorated dining room, with a moroccan and french menu.  Food was good and the live music even better. Check out was efficient too.  My mother forgot a rain jacket in room 317, one week later Dec 9, we called and Mr. Musin from the front office, called us back telling us that they…",4
"This is a beautifully appointed 150-year-old hotel that has sacrificed none of it's early 20th century charm while providing every modern convenience travelers expect.  From the doorman who greets every vehicle entering the curved driveway, to the concierge who graciously provides expert assistance with any and all needs, to the staff who insure that fresh mint tea is always available for guests in the lobby...the entire staff is welcoming, friendly and impressively professional.  Tip: Consider having the concierge book a private guide to tour the city; the all-inclusive price is well worth all that you will see and learn, and you won't get lost in the Medina!! The decor, reminiscent of the painter, Mastisse, who once made this hotel his home, is elegantly old world French.  Do…",5
"It is located higher than the old city, 20 min walking distance from ferry port and 2 min walk from old city gate. The hotel occupies large ground with beautiful gardens, bar, cafe, and restaurant. It even has live Morocco music bank with belly dancer in the dinner time. The room is not large but comfortably decorated. However, the bathroom facility is far below expectation, my shower heads burst with burning hot water and cold water every 2 minutes and it seems not fixable. By the way, the Mercedes I reserved for my excursion mysteriously become a plain Skoda and it has some very strong cleaner smell.",5
"We were traveling on the cheap for most of our vacation, but decided to spend one fancy night here. No regrets! The manager went out of his way to make our splurge worthwhile, including giving us a private tour of the room that Matisse stayed in when he painted ""Windows at Tangier."" The room has been perfectly preserved in the decades since and is absolutely worth taking a peek at -- just ask!",5
"Good facility, Very friendly and helpful staff. Good restaurant and bar facilities. Good view and central location close to the old town. Pool area small but nice, the WiFi was poor in the rooms but ok in the general areas. Breakfast was great.",5
A very lovely hotel decorated with wooden carvings. Room was large and spacious even decorated on the ceiling. Food served was excellent and location is very convenient for shopping either in the Medina or on the modern streets.,5
Grand hotel villa de France is an  amazing hotel after you have come out of the riads!. The location is extremely convenient. It is right across the street from the Médina.  It is also walkable distance for shops and other eateries.  The concierge at the hotel recommended two restaurants for us which were extraordinary. The hotel restaurant is also great and they have a belly Dancer. The rooms were spacious and very clean and breakfast was the best in Morocco.  The only inconvenience is how you need to get to your room 2 elevator rides ---but it only took a few minutes. I highly recommend this hotel !,5
"We are still in Morocco Casablanca after spending 3 nights in Grand Hotel. I couldn't wait to get to the stay to write a review, the hotel has what i was looking for old style and tradition of Morocco.  There are new and more modern hotel ( which you can get that anywhere in the States )  and  Tangire as well.  However,  if you are looking to travel in time back 1930's and spend few days where Matisse spent 2 years painting and other celebrities of the times stay you  book here. The services was up standing no complaints. Now be aware is in the botton of the old makert and it can be overwhelming if you are not aware how aggressive the locals can be. Have fun and dont skip the breakfast is absolutely amazing enjoy  and don't drink the local water or ice. Namaste. ",5
"This recently renovated late 19th century palace offers 360 degree views over Tangier. After a recent renovation, it is one of the best places to stay in town with comfortable rooms, spacious bathrooms, good service, a great jazzy cocktail bar and a restaurant which offers both Western and Moroccan cuisine. Highly recommended.",5
"This hotel lived up to my expectations and was an oasis of calm after the hustle of the streets outside.  Our stay had a fabulous start when we were upgraded to a duplex suite overlooking to pool and the city beyond.  The suite was clean with a full and half bath, stocked fridge and complimentary water.  We had a small terrace overlooking the pool.  Drinks at the bar were pricey, (but great service),  and we did get directions to a store to buy beer and wine for our suite.  The provided breakfast was good but could be picked over if you arrived later.  We had dinner one night at the hotel, it was good but not cheap.  It was a beautiful room but very bright, turning the light down in the evening would add to the charm.  We enjoyed the musicians performing during dinner.  The…",5
"Oh boy, what a shame. It promises so much - old world charm, marble everything but the reality is different. The food is awful and very skimpy. The fridge in the room was locked and we were not allowed the key!  ( it was turned on though) There was no water provided at all and no glasses. We asked for some water but it did not arrive during the length of our stay ( overnight ) . The Airconditioning did not work. The place stunk.  Oh i can't be bothered going into any more detail - apart from there was no service at all. We asked for butter and watched while the message passed on from the Maitre'd to the next waiter and down the line I  guess but butter did not appear. We were told it would be five minutes but no it didn't happen. Go somewhere else.  Sadly I cannot recommend…",1
Smells like garbage. I’m really tired of Morocco in general. We stay in hostels often and are not hard to please but if we are staying in one of the “better” hotels in the city that is also expensive it shouldn’t smell like rotten trash. We are paying over $125 a night and just had a $150 dinner with wine and dessert and they have us in this crappy room overlooking concrete and trash.   I would say don’t bother booking this place or anything considered “nice” in this city. Spend half and get the same quality,2
"Location was excellent, if you are visiting as a tourist, the service was as good as can be, it is an old memory hotel , home for the great Matisse painter , a small hotel , renovated to keep the same old style , of this 150 year old holel . Nice dining at night with a great and professional service , the staff at the reception were helpful and very polite and welcoming, the breakfast was ok , but I loved the instant pancake like bread , not forgetting the good service of Yousef, one of the negative points is the bathroom, it was not practical, I would have substituted the bath tub to good shower. But on the whole we enjoyed our three nights stay. ",4
"Well, I was disappointed about this place. It seems they live just from the past and it lost its atmosphere. Rooms are clean but stink from the antibacterial products they use. Everything you touch is kind a sticky and feels filthy. Furniture could use a major update. Breakfast buffet is big but overall not very tasty. The breakfast room itself has no atmosphere. Staff is ok. Not very attentive. Poolarea is nice. The place is centrally located and close to soma attractions.  I have been here once and that was it.",3
"From the moment we checked in the staff were uninterested and uncooperative when we were faced with 2 room door cards which did not work.  Considering to get to our room from the reception, we had to walk down a corridor, up a flight of stairs, out through a courtyard, into another building, and then up another flight of stairs (the lift wasn't working), and back again numerous times to get the key issue sorted, and then the air-conditioning was sub-standard, and the room cramped.The room overlooked the pool and was noisy as a result.",2
"From the moment we arrived we were well received and got the possibility of an early check in. Lovely historic building with all facilities, spotless rooms, nice pool, great breakfast and top location. The late check out was an additional bonus. Staff is friendly, professional and never intrusive. Good value for money. Can only recommend it.",5
"They are doing up the El Minzah which is closed (2018) and the beloved pool, by which I have sipped cocktails for 50 years, is a hole in the ground. But the Villa de France, if you can manage the steps (only just for this 73 year old) is still super; wonderful views; nice pool; the Duplex apartments are lovely, worth paying extra. And the pool is very nice and essential.",5
Just spent a fantastic number of days in this hotel; so close to the Médina and close to the Marina where there are long walks along it’s extensive promenade.  The staff were the best and always willing to help! Many thanks for making our stay so pleasant!,5
"We had a wonderful couple of days in this wonderful hotel 2 minutes away from the old city of Tangiers and the Medina Gate. A warm friendly arrival to a historic clean immaculate room and hotel where we explored the city and had a delicious 5 star  meal on the terrace overlooking the old city I can recommend the fillet steak cooked at your table and the crepes suzette cooked perfectly by the restaurant manager. A memorable stay and we would highly recommend a stay here especially if you are a fan of Matisse, where he stayed and painted some famous views....you can visit his room kept carefully for guests to view.",5
We enjoyed the hotel so much and it was such a beautiful historic place. The service was excellent. And the pool was amazing.Younes took very good care of us on the patio for every dinner and was a lot of fun. The checkout experience was easy and everything was just perfect.,5
"The beautiful old pile has been lovingly restored and the location is convenient to everything in Tangier.  The service is attentive, competent and friendly without being overbearing.  It really is not a luxury hotel as advertised 9i.e., the bedding is a little more mid-range and the shower is of the old-fashioned European type with a hand nozzle attached to a pole rather than a proper showerhead) but the price is so low who cares.",5
"Typical Moroccan food at a buffet table that wrapped around one whole corner of the dining room. A wonderful selection of food. We didn't stay here, but the hotel looked very nice from what we experienced.",5
We’ve just spent a wonderful 2 days exploring Tangiers and the surrounding coast. The reception staff could not have been more helpful and attentive. They organised a super excursion for us and we liked the driver so much that we booked him again the next day. The hotel is beautiful with fabulous views of the city and sea and our room was luxurious with a separate living room. We will be back soon!,5
"I enjoy my stay in hotel villa de France is my first time. but is  Lovely hotel and good staf  good service in the restaurant spechely : Mr youness, Hicham, yousef and gerls team breakfast and staff of evening shift  The reseption was wonderful. The views in the hotel  very nice. my room is 109. Nice rooms in the hotel 🏩 rely is 5 star service ",5
"Beautiful hotel full of history, quite magical!The dinning was wonderful ! My fish was cooked to perfection, also I was taken care of very well by Younes and his great staff! Can’t fault the service! 😀🤩! ",5
This is a very nice old style hotel with modern amenities close to the Medina.Hotel has a nice outdoor area with good views. Breakfast was good with a good variety available. Rooms are small but quite comfortable.,4
We spend one night there and had dinner at their terrace.The food and the service were excellent .We also loved the rooms We will definitely go back when we are in Tangiers .It is very close to the old Medina  I,5
"I stayed last June in this hotel and I had a great time. Location is  ideal, just right outside de Medina, so everything is walking distance but  without been in the middle of the chaos. A taxi stop is just right in front of the hotel. It is  situated in an elevation with great views of the city. Service is excellent , very cordial and pending on every detail. The room was first class, clean, comfortable and gorgeous. The hotel has a beautiful pool but unfortunately is it extremely cold. A heated pool will give a 5 start to this hotel. The  restaurant was not that good and it was completely overprice, so you better try the many offers the city has for dinner. Breakfast is ok. They have very good live entertainment every night.  Nice hotel, I will definitely stay again if…",4
This hotel was recently (a couple of years ago) re-opened after an extensive renovation. They've done a lovely job. A bit pricier than most but has that French colonial feel. We complained about smoke odour they moved us to a better and smoke free room.  Most of the staff were attentive and helpful although a couple were more interested in what they could sell us (cab service touring) .  Wanted to see some Arab mjusicians laying in the dining room and the waiter initially didn't allow but when we came back later he did and gave us complimentary hors d'oeuvres.  As others have commented great view over the Medina.  Only draw back to location is there is a short walk up a hill to enter the hotel. Check whether local tax is included in your rate or not.,4
"A wonderful hotel with nice ambiance,friendly service and excellent views.I visited tangier june 2018 and stayed @ the Grand Villa De France Hotel it is a beautiful hotel with wonderful views,the rooms were beautifully decorated and clean. The front desk could not have have been any nicer they organized my train trip to Casablanca and also pre arranged a taxi to the train station. I would definitely stay again",4
"I ate lunch on the terrace last week so I cannot review the hotel as a guest who stayed, just one who ate. The service was terrible but food nice but very pricey. We were handed a menu and just left for at least 20 minutes. Then I went to find a waiter and the menu was taken away and replaced by a set price lunch menu. We wanted something light not four courses  ! There were no smiles, no helpfulness and just churlish responses to our questions.",3
"This hotel is in a good position and has nice historical “bones” as the pictures will show.  But the service was terrible and the junior suite I had was a disappointment - it smelt, was stuffy and had no view or airflow, so best avoided.  Five or six requests were either ignored or messed up.  From start to finish the service was very poor!  Requests to ice ignored (i.e acknowledged but never responded to), request to move room ignored, no room service menu available, request for more drinking water - first ignored and then charge of 50 MAD proposed on delivery, linen not changed, breakfast limited to basic continental, time to ferry port stated one day (when transfer booking made) as 45 minutes and then next day (when departing) 1 hour 20 minutes, and finally when checking out…",2
"     I had been looking forward to lunch here for quite some time. It was our first destination after arriving in Tangier for the terrace overlooking the city, its history as a home of/inspiration for Matisse , the piano bar and its reputation as providing a special experience. It is also one of the few places in Tangier that serves wine or drinks.                                                                                   We had to seat ourselves and after we were given a menu and ready to order, we were handed a different  menu for 3 courses with limited selections and a 350 dirham/$35 USD price. We were told the first menu was for dinner only. When we spoke with another server--maybe the manager?--he gave us the first menu again as requested and we ordered. For 230…",3
Right in the heart of Tanger could not be better placed - everything rather tired and in need of a bit of TLC but quaint with helpful staff especially the guide they found us - ask for Yousef he's marvellous,4
"After three years living in Morocco, I finally managed to pass by Tangier downtown. What a pleasant surprise, and how come didn't I come earlier? The Grand Hotel Villa de France is a charming hotel, where we can feel history. I was lucky enough to stay in a suite, with fantastic views on two sides of the hotel, and very comfortable! The staff is very friendly and helpful, the hotel is very well placed near the old city's attractions. Can't wait to get back there with my family and spend more time on the nice terraces of the Villa de France.",5
"We wanted to stay at this historic hotel, made famous by Matisse and from the moment we stepped into the foyer we were impressed by the service. Mourad welcomed us warmly and we were served traditional mint tea and pastries.   Mourad could not have been more helpful, organising a local guide to take us on a walking tour and kindly organising the purchase of our train tickets to Casablanca at our request - nothing was too much trouble!  The hotel surpassed our expectations in every way. The elegant, tasteful decor, spacious comfortable rooms, manicured gardens and spectacular view from the terrace made our first night in Morocco very memorable.  We had a delicious dinner watching the sun set across the misty ocean in the distance, listening to the call to prayer, then later…",5
Visited Tangier with family/friends and stayed at the Grand Hotel. It is beautiful and the view from our room was stunning!! The concierge was so helpful upon check in and arranged a city tour that was perfect!!! Would definitely stay here again!!!,5
Location is good and close to the medina and souks. That said. The medina and souks actually seemed dangerous and we left both times due to feeling unsafe. The hotel was lovely inside but the restaurant menu was limited and stupid expensive £4 for a bottle of water!! The staff were a 50/50 mix of either very helpful or completely indifferent. Wouldn’t stay there again or Tangier. It looks like a favela as you arrive by train except maybe a bit more dangerous ,2
"The hotel has the 18th century charm befitting its date of construction and historic importance - Matisse not only stayed here, but also created a fine painting while here. The location of the hotel is significant, close to the medina. In a way, you have to earn your stay, walking up a serious hill to the building. We were safe here, not only in feeling but also in reality. Now for the review. The Villa de France is truly old world style with gorgeous grounds, hand painted tiles and a fountain in courtyard. There was an unusual room number system, get over it. The room was a fine size and the bed comfortable. The attractive bathroom had a large bathtub and separate shower. We had a beautiful views from our room of the water. Late dinner was even later due to disorganization, but…",5
A nice Hotel on the edge of the Medina. Room spacious and clean with an old world touch. Great view over the bay. Comfortable bed and bathroom with good water pressure. Breakfast adequate. Had a couple of drinks in the bar area with very friendly staff looking after a group of us. Prices a bit steep but not over the top. Fast wifi and would stay here again.,4
"This hotel has heaps of potential given the beautifully landscaped grounds and views overlooking the Medina. Unfortunately we felt the the room itself was a little too dark (lacked enough natural light). As we were with a group, breakfast was available a little earlier for us (thank you for this), but unfortunately most of the food that was intended to be hot was cold.",4
Out group really enjoyed the entertainment provided while having dinner.  The Moroccan culture was demonstrated by both the musical instruments and the belly dancer.  Nothing is as rich as an experience that expresses the culture!!,5
"Once grand, if now slightly faded, colonial-style hotel on the edge of the medina in Tangier. Layout is quite labyrinthine -- getting from the lobby to our room was something of an adventure, but the room itself (superior double) was clean and fairly spacious. Service had its quirks -- extra water requested was never delivered and attempts to access the bottles in our minibar were complicated by the fact that access to it actually required a gentleman to come to the room to open it with his (the only?) key. Excellent (included) breakfast buffet. Overall, a good choice in Tangier for a traditional hotel -- as opposed to a riad -- especially for its proximity to the medina (5 min walk to gate at Place du 9 Avril 1947).",4
"It couldn’t be better located for walking both the old and new parts of town.  The staff are excellent and it was really convenient to have the onsite parking as we had our car.  The hotel itself is charming- our room was huge with a great view. Excellent water pressure, very comfy bed.  The pool area is really relaxing and lunch outside on the terrace is pricey but delicious.  Breakfast was a bit picked over by the time we got there and the room it was in was a bit tired but the helpful staff were on hand for made to order eggs and Moroccan tea. Overall an oasis in a bustling city. ",5
This was one of the best stays of our escorted tour.  The hotel was very secure and safe.  There was a guard on duty at all times and the grounds were walled.  The view overlooking the bay was breathtaking!  The meals were fantastic.,5
Room is up a steep incline to begin with so keep that in mind if you are moving your own luggage.  Very odd and confusing room set up as well.   I’m not quite sure why people like these very old hotels and how they ever get the ratings they give them.  Room and bathroom are very small although had quality linens and towels.  Headboard at bed and border around room was interesting.   Pressure in shower was very good but when water hit the door enclosure it sounded like drilling.  On a tour and a dinner was included which was good but small portions and not enough wait staff for group size.  Couldn’t change a 100€ into smaller bills!!,3
"We stayed 3 nights and had a very comfortable, large room with a great view over the medina to the sea, similar to the view Matisse had when he stayed here. The hotel has recently been refurbished in a grand old style.  The bathroom was very elegant in marble. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The swimming pool looked great, but the weather was cool when we were there, so we didn't go in.  Breakfast had a good selection of cheese, cold cuts, fruit and pastry.  The location is excellent, between the medina and the new town.  Very close to the best fish restaurant - Le Saveur de Poisson.  Also close to a very good patisserie - Al Andalus.  We would definitely stay at this hotel again if we return to Tangier. ",5
"We stayed at this hotel as part of a Insight group and have to say it is quite quaint as it has an old world charm about it. The rooms are very comfortable and quite large, well appointed and clean. The food we had was quite enjoyable with quite an extensive wine list at reasonable prices. Breakfast is to come tomorrow but by going with the standard I am sure it will be up to scratch. The staff were attentive and very helpful and spoke English. I would certainly stay here again.",4
