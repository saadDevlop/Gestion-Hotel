"We spent are first night in Morocco at this lovely hotel. It is well situated. The staff was very helpful especially Abdellatif Lotfi rooms operations manager. He went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and happy with our room. The room was large, well appointed and comfortable.  Thank you Abdellatif.",5
"Though only staying for one night La Tour Hassan Palace was a very pleasant place to be. Good sized bedroom and bathroom overlooking the pool.  Very well maintained, the whole place oozed quality. Hotel a mix of the traditional and the modern. The area around the pool offered shade from the hot sun and good quality bar meals were available here. Breakfast offers a large choice and is also taken by the pool. The staff at all times were extremely good, pleasant and efficient. Very highly recommended.",5
"Lovely hotel but lacking in service.  At the pool in afternoon. Everyone standing around. No one came to offer service. Finally went up to bar to request service. Told someone would be out. No one came. Once again went to bar, ordered. Took 45 minutes to receive 2 drinks!  Made reservation for a car pickup to go to,a restaurant. Never e arrived. After 30 minutes got a taxi from street. Manager never available during those times.",5
"This hotel is very impressive. I would say it‚Äôs more on the scale to a higher end hotel. From check in to check out everything was just perfect. The staff were wonderful. It was my birthday and they surprised me by brining a cake to our room. That was the most sweetest, kindest and thoughtful thing someone could do. I really appreciated that and thank you to all of you at the Hassan Palace. Our room was so beautiful and comfortable. The breakfast was really good. You‚Äôre made to feel that it was all especially prepared for you. The pool was nice but water was very cold. We also experienced our first hamman here and it was really the best.  The hotel is close to town and walking distance to the Medina.",5
"A wonderful hotel.  We spent two nights there . Great service,  wonderful assortment for breakfast, comfortable room spacious and clean, easy access to major sights and restaurants. Highly recommend. Beautiful garden.",5
"LOVELY hotel!  This was our ""splurge"" while in Morocco, but it was well worth it.  Lovely staff, lobby, pool area, etc.  The rooms are clean, but a bit small.  However, the service was impeccable.  Every night there was a knock on the door to see if we needed anything.  If we didn't, they handed us chocolates :)  Would highly recommend!",5
"We stayed here for three nights during the summer and had a wonderful experience. The staff was all very friendly, and fluent in English / French / Moroccan Arabic. Any small or minor issue that came up was resolved quickly. Breakfast is incredible -- good mix of Moroccan-style breakfast foods and more ""western"" style foods.  The ""gym"" is about what you'd expect from a hotel gym, but unfortunately only one of the treadmills was working so had to wait a little while to jog. The free weights and machines were well maintained.  Room was comfortable and had a nice view of the interior courtyard. Room service takes about 45 minutes and seems to come from the restaurants (very wide variety of food, and very high quality).   Location is excellent -- you can walk from the train station (about 10 minutes), and also to the waterfront / market areas.  Finally, the building itself is stunning -- it's a beautiful mix of old, traditional Moroccan tiles and mosaics and fountains, with a modern flare.   Highly recommend:  - Get something to eat from the Moroccan restaurant. We had a chicken tagine that was incredible, and the fish was very good too.  - Spend some time by the pool. There is seating in the shade and sun, and the ambiance / surroundings are beautiful and relaxing.  - Have a drink on the outdoor patio and enjoy the architecture. Don't take the beautiful building for granted!‚Ä¶",5
"Highly recommended!  Our family enjoyed staying at the Tour Hassan Palace Hotel for a week.  Our room was spacious, quiet and clean with a lovely view of the courtyard and pool.  Breakfast was a generous buffet of fresh juices and fruits, breads and pastries and custom-cooked egg dishes and crepes as well as hot and cold traditional Moroccan food.  We ate dinner there several evenings and the food was wonderful. Staff were attentive and helpful arranging taxis.  Location is good, in walking distance of the old waterfront area and markets as well as the Tour Hassan itself.  We would be happy to return.",5
"As pilot flying to Rabat I‚Äôm used to come to La tour Hassan hotel. It‚Äôs always a great pleasure to come here. Always a warm welcome and I feel like home. Service is warm and welcoming in every part of the hotel. It‚Äôs very clean, rooms are calm and the food is great. Small but beautiful spa. No way to go elsewhere üôÜ",5
"Had a lunch in the epicurien restaurant , and it was amazing , so pleased about the hospitality and the joyful conversation of the mettre of the restaurant monsieur Mohamed  that made us enjoying our lunch  and the food was very delicious food  a bit expensive but it worth it , very charming table next to the pool with a nice view of the garden , nice experience",5
"This hotel was lovely from start to finish. Every staff member we met was helpful, friendly. They arranged cars for us. Made recommendations. Once we had eaten in the hotel restaurant (DELICIOUS) a couple tunes they started making suggestions and one might even brought some special menu items as they prepare to bring back (since Covid) more dining options in July.  The food was amazing. Good presentation. Delicious and creative and interesting. Food Service a little slow for our American personalities but I think this was also due to just scaling back up now from Covid cutbacks.  The breakfast buffet!!! So good",5
"This hotel is such an amazing place to be. You just can't miss it. I dearly encourage guests and tourists to make this beautiful and warm receptive hotel their home. The Moroccan food is just too tasteful and satisfying. Special gratitude to Dalal, she is very much resourceful, kind and helpful. Enjoy the moment in this great hotel of Rabat, the city of life.",5
I want to thank the whole team of the hotel especially the receptionist Najwa and also Dalal who took the trouble to move and meet our needs. Big thanks for you ! We became a loyal guest to La Tour Hassan Palace haha ! Thank you Rabat üíê thank you Morocco ,4
"We stayed here for six nights and enjoyed every moment of its quiet Moroccan charm and excellent service. Conveniently located in downtown Rabat, the hotel combines old-fashioned elegance with modern amenities.  Scrumptious and copious breakfast buffets were enjoyed in the lovely garden, and dinners by the pool were enlivened by delightful conversations in English, French, and Franglais with our charming waiter Mohammed Bentaher.  The only fault was the enormous and heavy duvet on the otherwise comfortable bed--it was too hot for June!",5
"When we first arrived, the hotel had overbooked (supposedly with some part of the Moroccan royal entourage) and they had to rebook us for one night elsewhere.  We were so disappointed, but lovely English-speaking manager Ayoub said we could use the breakfasts, the terrace, the pool, and still be a guest, just sleeping a few meters away.  By the next morning we were booked into the Tour Hassan Palace for the next couple of nights.  We enjoyed its lovely touches, extreme cleanness, gracious setting right next to all the Rabat sights, this place was a haven after busy tourist days!  The breakfast buffet and eating area was scrumptious in every way.  The best kind of Moroccan hospitality among all the employees, including in the restaurants.  This was a splurge for us, and worth it.",5
"I have stayed here several times and every time is perfect. The hotel staff are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable, and always very clean. Younes and Najwa are always incredibly welcoming and helpful. If you ever stay in Rabat, I definitely recommend this hotel. It‚Äôs within walking distance of great and affordable restaurants as well as the Medina and other places to go sight seeing.",5
"We booked 4 deluxe rooms.When arriving hotel we were the only guest but still check in took 20 minutes. The rooms were nice but could be in better condition including cleaning. Only 1 small water bottle( very unusual  for Morocco) No coffee ,no Tea( cattle and coffee maker were in the room)When I asked for coffee or tea and water, I was told that this is on extra charge. No shower cap,no laundry bag ,no pencil. Next morning next unpleasant meeting.It took us about 40 minutes and around 12 requests to receive coffee and tea.For the bread someone ales got angry and not me.The same for receiving a Yogurt or a spoon. When we asked to complain and to receive a compensation only after our persistence and not relinquish they sad we could have dinner on there account in the hotel.We‚Ä¶",1
This hotel is a generous helping of Moroccon hospitality. It clearly is the choice of stay for statesmen and celebrities and it is clear why. Space and cleanliness internally and then gardens of paradise outside. Good food selection. Not the cheapest by far in Rabat but you are paying for history and class.,5
"This is an excellent, luxury hotel in the heart off Rabat. It boasts Rabat's best restaurant, with magical Tajines to tempt the palate. Comfortable rooms with massive king-sized beds. Good free WiFi. Nice helpful staff. Lovely gardens and pool. No wonder this hotel has played host to international stars and celebrities.",5
The amount of cultural appropriation in this hotel is unbelievable.  All the pictures and paintings on the walls belong to Algeria.  women in photos were wearing Algerian Traditional Attires yet they were claimed to be Moroccan  this made me question everything I have seen in Morocco.,1
"We are an Algerian couple we stayed at this hotel last April to visit our friends the problem we encountered is The amount of cultural appropriation at this hotel is unbelievable. All photos and paintings on the walls belong to Algeria. the women in the photos were wearing traditional Algerian outfits but they were claimed to be Moroccan, this made me question everything I have seen in Morocco",1
"My wife and I arrived on an 80+ degree day and was shocked there was no air conditioning in the hotel. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to sleep in those conditions. We tried to open the window only to be serenaded by barking dogs all night. To make things worse the bed was very hard and was not at all comfortable. So needless to say we didn‚Äôt get any sleep when we were there. Stay away, especially in the summer.",2
"We stayed at the Tour Hassan Palace for 3 nights before starting our tour of Morocco. It was wonderful. Located right in the heart of the City. The staff was very attentive, went above and beyond to provide the information and services we needed. The accommodations were wonderful, the breakfast perfect and the evening meal to break the fast was fantastic! We scheduled massages; they were wonderful and the grounds were manicured to perfection. I would highly recommend!",5
"My wife and I spent two nights at La Tour Hassan at the end of February 2022.  Overall, it was a nice stay with only one issue.  As I understood the history of the hotel, it was built in 1915 and has been renovated several times.  Presently, the hotel is very modern but retains its original geometric decorations.  The present main entrance is at ground level (-1 on the elevator).  The original entrance can be seen and is quite ornate, but involved quite a number of steps, which is a problem for disabled access.  The neighborhood appears to be safe.  We walked around the neighborhood and never felt unsafe.   The staff has been excellent ‚Äì they are polite and ready to help.  All the staff that I had interaction with spoke good English.  Our room was adequately large.  It had a‚Ä¶",4
"We had the most wonderful time at the hotel. You feel good from the moment you arrive. The receptionists are very professional and above all friendly. Very good gastronomy; you risk getting fat by eating well;) ;)... Smiling, helpful, attentive, calm, etc.",5
"We stayed at the hotel for 4 weeks on a business trip. Staff were friendly and helpful, great location near the bazaar and river, with lots of good bars and restaurants nearby. Rooms were spacious and clean, the toiletries were excellent, all argan based. Wifi is strong and stable.   We would have given it a 5 star if it wasn‚Äôt for the gym which was a big disappointment. Most of the machines don‚Äôt work, if they do, they‚Äôre grimy. There are no towels, water nor sanitizers to wipe up before or after use. The mats were smelly and dirty. The machines are stained and grimy.   It‚Äôs such a shame because the view from the gym is overlooking the pool which was beautiful. We hope they improve this area. ",4
We are staying at Tour Hassan Palace as a group for the past 10 days. I can only say the hotel and staff have been excellent. Given the current situation they have gone the extra mile to ensure our visit is of the highest quality. The rooms are comfortable and all amenities are of a high standard. Housekeeping always do a great job and make sure the room is clean and tidy. The restaurant and Bar staff are most accommodating to our needs and we enjoy a very nice breakfast daily with plenty of variety. Overall I would recommend this property and look forward to returning,5
"I would like to thank for such a  wonderful stay in this lovely resort . Spacious and clean room , nice pool and lovely garden where you can enjoy your meal or just have a relaxing day . Absolutely lovely and attentive staff especially  Mr.Nabil and Mr. B.Mohamed . Look forward for another visit.",5
"Stay in this hotel left us with a very bad aftertaste about the city of Rabat, which they represent for tourist coming for one night to stay. Unfortunately the management does not seem to understand this simple fact.  Because of this experience I will recommend to avid Rabat to everyone who will ask.  The hotel is well maintained and the rooms are fairly comfortable. What tipped us off was the food. Their restaurant is probably the worst one we had in Morocco. Incredible bland and uninspiring. There was not a single item, out of 6 we tried, we liked. All tagines hand exactly the same taste - unseasoned.  The way they treated us with respect to breakfast was simply disguising. At the check in we were informed that the breakfast buffet starts at 7:30.  We showed up at 8 to find‚Ä¶",2
"As I came many times in Morocco i did morrocan bath quite often but I didnt know the real one till i met Meryem! She s just the best! I couldnt enjoy it more than this!ill come back for her, definitely! Shukran!",5
"I feel that its mandatory to review this place. They respected all the measures of COVID-19, that I was afraid of. It was an amazing experience, and I am happy to discover such a wonderful hotel. Thank you for your hospitality and professionalism.",5
"This hotel is great.  Large comfortable rooms, beautiful courtyard and garden.  The breakfast is simply amazing.  Staff wonderful, as are all service industry people in Morocco so far.  Only reason not five stars is, as others have mentioned, it was not possible to turn on the air conditioning in February but it was quite warm.  There is a very large window which can be opened, and that cools the room,  but then the outside noises come in.  Which were minimal and included nice music.  At the next update it would be good if the guest could choose whether they want heat or air or neither.   The outdoor bar was delightful.  I wandered to it by mistake so not sure which floor it is on.  Up at least a level from the courtyard and main restaurant.  Overall, highly recommended property‚Ä¶",4
Our group stayed here for one night. Beautiful lobby and bar. The room wasn‚Äôt as Impressive. Great breakfast included with the room. Great selection of both hot and cold items. Delicious pastries too!,4
"This hotel is very nice. Many pros and only a few cons.  The room (221) was nice and faced a courtyard. The room was a little warm, and once I realized that both the AC and Heat settings on the thermostat blew warm air, I turned it off. BIG window along the wall facing the courtyard, and that stayed open most of my stay.  The room was well appointed. There was a plate of cookies and bottled water upon arrival.  Our group ate at two of the restaurants, La Maison Arabe and L'Epicurien. We had breakfast included which was served in the Imperial restaurant.  All the food was very good and well priced (i.e. relatively inexpensive for a hotel restaurant). The breakfast buffet was very good and very broad. Fresh fruit was wonderful and the fresh juices were a great way to start the‚Ä¶",5
Very popular long standing hotel in a Spanish style with a attentive staff. Large rooms with several quirks. The AC and heat cannot be run at the same time. One or the other is activated at different times of the year. The tub shower with a half glass is very high with NO safety grab bars to help getting in or out. The speed buttons on the phone did not work and we found it hard to reach the front desk. You have to dial a direct number which was not posted by the phone. Recommend. Hope this helps.,4
"What a great hotel. The room was just lovely and staff so helpful and friendly. Really enjoyed my stay there and would definitely recommend. The food in the Moroccan restaurant was superb, the best dining experience I had in Morocco",5
"This was our first stay during our 2 weeks in Morocco.  The hotel lobby is absolutely beautiful-ornate tile work and comfortable seating areas.  Dates and fresh fruit always available.  The waterfall outside was eye catching.  The pool area and grounds were very nice.  Our first room was very stuffy, so we opened the window.  The room backed up to the kitchen so we immediately heard all the kitchen noise.  The cooking odors quickly permeated the whole room.  Plus the electronic safe didn't work.  We were able to change rooms to one overlooking the pool area.  It was so much better-quieter and without the cooking smells...and the safe worked!  The bath amenities were really nice and fragrant.  There was a plate of yummy cookies and a plate of fruit plus bottled water. The‚Ä¶",4
"Room, clean and comfy but very small for 2. Unable to walk around bed if desk being used. High supplement for double occupancy. Had to ask for more towels, glasses etc as only set up for one. Never did get an extra cup! Tea and coffee making facilities: 2 coffee pods for whole weeks stay and no teabags (available at cost). Never in 40 years of world travel have I ever stayed in a hotel, Riad, bed and breakfast or apartment and been charged for tea bags. A few hours late checkout, charged at 50% of room rate. Breakfast cost ¬£25, cafe close by was ¬£2.50 (fresh juice, eggs, olives, bread, tea or coffee). Charged extra ¬£50 on final bill, reception staff somewhat miffed when we noticed. Will go elsewhere on our next visit to Rabat.",3
"This is an excellent hotel, with excellent service. I was here only one night, but it was a pleasant stay. The room was quiet, large and clean, the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was large and clean. I would stay here again.",5
"A Lovely comfortable room. Enjoyable breakfast, filling and had a nice Moroccan feel. Stunning pool area.... Didn't get to use the pool but the view from the room was beautiful, and walking in the area was relaxing. Hotel was well situated, and I enjoyed walking in the area around the hotel.",4
"Every year I visit I am impressed with the experience. Hotel smells nice, looks nice and is very comfortable. I look forward to the Spa every year. The warm reception at the door is always something I can count on.",5
Hotel is nice but my room could have been larger and was a bit dated. Mattress needed to be flipped over as there were hollows on each side of the bed. Nice breakfast buffet. Staff members are overall nice and professional.,4
"Great hotel, and staff. True Moroccan experience. Service was exceptional. Garden and pool wonderful. Right in the center of town easy to get around to many cool places. I have to say the food was very good. The overall experience was very relaxed and charming. ",5
We really enjoyed our brief stay at this hotel. It was centrally located within walking distance of the major sites in Rabat. There were many restaurant options within walking distance as well. We also had a great time at the spa with a luxurious hammam.,5
Close to old city and wonderful service and restaurants.  I strongly recommend this hotel for a short or long stay.  I would be happy to stay there again.  I am a regular global business traveler and La Tour Hassan sets a high standard.,5
"Good food and good location.  I was able to walk to the main boulevard as well as the Kasbah but the real test came when my wife discovered, on Day 1, that she needed batteries for her electric tooth brush.  After explaining what I needed and the size, one of the desk clerks ask for some money and volunteered to go get them for me.  When he returned, he called my room and I came down and got them and my change.  The batteries turned out to be about half of what I would have paid in the U.S.  Clerk then refused a tip.  I cannot imagine getting this kind of service in any major city hotel in the U.S.  We would definitely stay there again should the opportunity to do so present itself.",4
"La Tour Hassan is a nice large hotel with all the amenities you would expect of a four-star hotel. (They are not quite a five-star hotel, in my opinion, but they are still good.)   The interior has a lot of Moroccan charm, and there are nooks and crannies throughout the place to sit and enjoy a tea and conversation. The outdoor area is lovely and the restaurant (Maison Arabe) on-site is quite nice. Breakfast is varied with fresh options as well as many pastries and hot dishes. The wait staff is friendly, attentive, and aims to please. The front desk is also amiable and does its best to make guests happy.  There's a small ""business center"" with a couple computers and a printer. And the location is very near to the medina and other things you might want to see in Rabat.  We used‚Ä¶",4
The hotel is historic and full of beautiful tile as one would hope to find in Morocco. There is a large and beautiful inner courtyard with a nice pool. Our room was huge. Everyone was friendly. The hotel is in the center of town.,5
We arrived from Paris and our group were provided a bus for transportation to the hotel.   Weather was very good.   Good to bring some light extra layers of clothes as the evenings mat be a little cooler than the days.   The staff quickly checked us into our rooms for a welcome rest.,5
"Really enjoyed my stay here. We were there for a night in November, Rooms definitely have a luxurious feel, and the location is perfect if you‚Äôre willing to visit Rabat.  An Amazing rooftop and exceptional jazz bar with live music show, the service was exceptional , the quality of food specially the breakfast was stoning, I tried the Moroccan soup Harira and a special oil called ARGAN oil, and a special almond butter called Amelou , it was amazing and very tasty, although it was raining this morning but people made feel so welcome  Thank you",5
"The Tour Hassan Palace in Rabat is absolutely Exceptional! What a destination. Honestly the service the cleanliness the staff absolutely everything was perfect.  This was our Our second stay at this hotel this year, we came in on the 27 October and left on the 1st November. It was even better than the first. Upgraded to a beautiful suite, all the staff were friendly and helpful especially at breakfast where we had the best breakfast ever in Morocco, the pool staff was amzing, and the Moroccan restaurant was so delicious that we decided to have diner twice in our stay.  Thank you hope will come back on january",5
"This was an amazing stay in, we were there  with travl link for two nights, people were very nice, the breakfast was wonderfull, with a huge choice of vienoiserie, salads, eggs and some moroccan pastries , the waiters were very attentive, rooms were very clean, and the sight on the garden was just wonderfull, thank you again, hope will stay there another time",5
"The hotel is in a prime location close to lots of restaurants, the Medina, downtown, grocery store, historic sites, etc.  Rooms are clean but small.  Very nice garden, lots of coaches/chairs to sit, relax, and enjoy a meal.  Nice small gym but no air conditioner; they need to have sanitizer to clean the equipment before and after use by guest.  The concierge should have a basic understanding of English.  Morocco is a beautiful country and lots of tourists visit.  This is supposedly a five star hotel and the staff should have an average knowledge of English.",4
"We were part of a tour group that spent two nights at the La Tour Hassan Palace. This is a superior hotel and well-located in the heart of Rabat. The accommodations were very nice. The hotel features a beautiful courtyard with gardens and a pool that invite the visitor to relax and enjoy the hotel. It was quiet with very good service. Our luggage was misplaced on our arrival, but the staff immediately started a search and found our luggage quickly (it had been mislabeled by the tour company). The hotel restaurant provided us with a buffet that satisfied everyone's appetite. The breakfast bar was well supplied with fruits, pastries, cereals, eggs, meat, cheese, etc. I recommend La Tour Hassan Palace as a place to stay in Rabat.",5
"Hotel ambiance, food is excellent. Room size is very average. The most negative part of this hotel is the staff, all are not very verse of English. On reception the staff is not very friendly and not giving a good welcome. They keep you standing while they are busy in their own world, neither they ask the customer to take a seat, until you don't intervene you will have to keep waiting. Room service is also very poor as they take their own good time to respond to your query or request that is made.  ",2
"A truly magnificent hotel with service to match. Every action by the staff is geared toward the comfort of the quest. We booked a massage for my husband and I upon arriving. The spa was well appointed, meticulous clean and tidy. The therapist were obviously highly trained.  The pool area was gorgeous, not a leaf out of place! The hotel was built in 1912 and has many renovations so it is modern but has not lost the luxury of the original intent of the hotel. You get the ultimate service of bygone days in a beautiful up to date hotel. We would not hesitate to stay again. Many thanks for our wonderful experience ",5
"Located in the heart of the city within walking distance to many tourist sites.  Elegant and refined in every detail, yet inviting and warm.  The friendly welcome by M Taoufig, and M Soufiane was appreciated, and their english skills were  impressive.   My room was ready and check in was efficient and quick.  My room 219  exceeded all expectations, air conditioning, free WiFi,and delicious Moroccan sweets.  Breakfast even had Scotch smoked salmon, and fresh squeezed juices every day.  The public areas are gorgeous with beautiful mosaics and a large courtyard, and of course a lovely swimming pool.   The hotel and staff exceeded all expectations, and I look forward to returning next year.",5
"Stayed 2 nights while touring Morocco and had a very pleasant experience. The room was very clean and well kept, the food in the restaurant was okay, the front desk staff were helpful and the breakfast buffet had a wide variety of offerings. We walked from the hotel to the medina in a short period of time, returning at night, and felt very safe.   Two words of caution: 1) don't accept a room on the lower floors if you're unable to walk up and down stairs - they do have an elevator but some rooms still require you to take stairs further down. 2) Count your money at the desk when exchanging!",4
"Today was our last day at La Tour Hassan Palace hotel after a one week stay for business. Also had my husband and nine year old daughter with me on this trip. Room was sparkling clean and the housekeeping staff were exceptional. The hotel itself was very pleasant. The pool was super quiet - my nine year old had it all to herself most afternoons. Room service was excellent and portions sizes were massive. Didn‚Äôt try the restaurants so can‚Äôt comment on that kind of dining experience. Reception staff were extraordinarily helpful. The guy at the cashier‚Äôs desk was very patient when I had a complicated check out (i.e., please charge this to this card and that to that card etc). Younes was phenomenal.

I am satisfied with the impeccable services of the hotel. The food variety and test are excellent. The room is excellent. I really thank everyone for making my stay amazing. not only the hotel service is perfect but its location is also.  I highly recommend the hotel for others and definitely will stay next time.,5
"Stayed at this hotel during a trip to attend a wedding in Rabat.  We were originally planning to stay elsewhere and had to change last-minute to here and have no regrets whatsoever.  The various restaurants have all been good; the breakfast buffet in the l‚ÄôImperial is opulent and delicious.  The staff are always eager to be helpful.  The Moroccan restaurant (Maison Arabe) is not to be missed.  Easy to get transportation with either a taxi or Careem, and not far from the main places you‚Äôll want to visit in Rabat.  The king-sized bed in our suite is comfortable although I personally prefer less puffy pillows.  WiFi has been fine (which is a must in Morocco, given the exorbitant rates for international cellular data service).  You‚Äôll note a lot of security while visiting this‚Ä¶",5
"The hotel is part of the culture of Morocco and Rabat as opposed to a ""chain"" experience.  The staff is highly professional, well trained, accommodating and amazingly friendly.  The rooms might be smaller, but immaculate and well maintained.  Moroccan elegant.  Nothing shabby at all.  Work out room is not extravagant, but well equipped for the basics and accessible with a nice view to the courtyard.  Centrally located to business, the train station, the Medina and restaurants, a lot within walking distance.  Staff usually recognizes you as a guest going and coming or around the facilities.  Really nice touch in personal follow up after a stay from guest relations to make sure everything was satisfactory and keep you coming back.  ",5

Dignitaries coming & going, foreign government officials, heads of state, security details everywhere, dramatic limousine arrivals and departures, quite exciting! We loved our stay so much. Our room had a great view of the gardens, pool, and fountains. The breakfast was just wonderful...excellent service! Live music in the Trendy Bar in the evenings. The new spa just opened...perfect! Would stay again on our next trip to Rabat.",5
"We initially had an Airbnb that was cancelled on us and Airbnb provided us with a credit to use towards any accommodation. We decided to book at La Tour Hassan Palace. I have to say the stay was excellent..partly because we went from a $26/night Airbnb to a $270/night hotel!  We were upgraded to the garden view room which had a king bed, and view of the garden. Everything was very clean, sheets were nice and washroom was big. They also had a currency exchange available at good rates(better than Casablanca airport).  Staff were friendly and they helped hail a cab for us. WiFi was excellent. Location was decent..about 15 mins walk to the Medina. You can always take a taxi for about 15dh which is like $2.

"When we arrived at the Tour Hassan Palace, we discovered that the advertised parking was on the street, not in a garage. The check in was friendly but it took a long time. When we finally got to the room, the key would not work in the lock. When I tried to call reception, the phone did not work so I had to walk downstairs to get help in locking the door. Then, we decided to eat at the hotel but the restaurants were deserted, perhaps because they were really overpriced. Finally, when I took a bath and my husband took a shower in the newly redecorated bathroom, it flooded.  What good is it to have a  heated toilet seat and fancy shower jets if the drains don‚Äôt work? The water was so deep that it spilled into the carpeted hallway and the bathroom was unusable. I also could not help‚Ä¶",2
"Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed during my time in Morocco. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the personnel. Once you get in the beautiful mauresque architecture overwhelm us like if we were traveling centuries back in time. The staff was extremely friendly especially M. Houda Bouadya, she was affable and very professional always there when we need her.  The hotel have a good emplacement in the city center with some shops nearby where i bought a doudou as a souvenir and the atmosphere there is so special that it really felt like home to me. All respect for all the guest relation staff who does a great job here; a true sample of the Moroccan excellent hospitality!",5
"We stayed at this very fine hotel in Rabat for the first two nights of our Morocco tour with Gate 1. This is a very upscale hotel in the heart of the city. Upon arrival we were given Moroccan mint tea and some small pastries. We were then assigned our room.   The hotel is beautiful with elaborate mosaics on almost all surfaces in the public areas. There is also a large courtyard that is beautifully landscaped with a large pool and wading pool. Rabat is the capital of Morocco and this hotel is near the parliament. Quite a few of the government officials were also staying at the hotel and it was quite interesting to see them all decked out in their robes, turbans, fez's and other garb. I was tempted to take a photo or two but thought it would be a bit too rude.  Our room was much‚Ä¶",4

"A charming hotel with high quality of services, nice food and accommodation. The location, near downtown, is well appreciated together with an upgrade to a deluxe room with its nice view on the Andalous garden.",4
"A colleague and I stayed there in April 2019 and had an amazing visit.  Close to the Old Medina markets.  The room was well-appointed; the food at the restaurants terrific.  We ate at the Moroccan restaurant (really delightful and not outrageously priced for dinner) and the ""western"" restaurant for lunch.  The staff were also flexible with they hit a glitch with my business credit card and arranged by transit to the airport early morning when I left for home.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Enjoyed stay, good food at breakfast and in restaurant. All the staff were very helpful and attentive especially Houda on Guest Relations who quickly resolved any queries to a satisfactory conclusion.",5
"Check-in took quite a long time. Room was so hot and was told to open the window but not ideal because of mosquitoes and other insects. However, Houda is very friendly and helpful because I knew her since she was working at Sofitel Jardin des Roses.",3
"Staying at this hotel is a pleasure. From check-in to check-out, the service from the staff is efficient and pleasant.  The hotel itself is beautiful, and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. Good fitness center, and nice outdoor pool.  Excellent breakfast, with again great service.",5
"This hotel lives up to it's name. It is absolutely a Palace with an unbelievable staff that treats each guest like royalty.   With every amenity right on the property such as authentic restaurants, bars with live music almost every night, comfortable indoor and outdoor lounge areas, a beautiful pool with fountains, a relaxing spa and massage facility, fitness center, business and conference rooms, Wifi, 24 hour room service, laundry and dry cleaning service, evening turn down service and the most caring, welcoming, and attentive staff I've ever had the pleasure of working with.   I thank you again Ms. Houda Bouadya with Guest Relations, as well as the entire staff for treating us like family and making us feel at home. After a three week stay, we were very sad to leave but‚Ä¶",5
"I loved my stay here and would like to commend the staff and their dedication. The check in and check out was smooth the room was comfortable as well. Loved the Moroccan sweets kept to welcome us. Their Arabian restaurant is a must go and the food is delicious with live local musicians playing  music :). I would especially like to thank Houda Bouadya  for being really helpful and giving all the right information to visit the city. She is great and very very helpful. The breakfast is good and provides wide variety, the gym however is small and have limited equipment. Overall, i enjoyed my stay here.",4
"We stayed here for a week-long work event in April and the service, food, and friendliness were all something to write home about.  The food in Rabat was very good generally, and Moroccan cuisine excellent, but the hotel's buffet breakfast and lunch provided for the event was plentiful in choices across the board, from fresh salads, broad choice of proteins--seafood, fish, meats, poulty--and delicious traditional dishes like couscous.  The service was so friendly.  Houda Bouadya from Guest Relations helped us with various requests, such as helping to book massage in the city, or the front desk for suggesting good restaurants to try.  Rabat felt very safe, and it was a beautiful time of year to visit.  The ocean air and breeze permeates the city, which was more green and verdant‚Ä¶",5
"Spent 4 days for a business trip. This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in. From Check in, to meals, the SPA and the pool area, it was fantastic. I would not stay anywhere else in RABAT. Houda Bouadya of guest relations is absolutely the best!!",5
" I took lunch in the quiet & beautiful setting by the pool overlooking the garden, this is the best decision i made since i was in a hurry and only in Rabat for half a day ! so i decided to come experience this hidden gem in the heart of the city. The staff is welcoming and very professional especially Ms. Houda from guest relations who showed me around - in a professional and yet very friendly manner - every corner of the great facilities this hotel has to offer. She even took care of my phone as my battery was dying so i enjoyed my lunch stress free :)  I would definitely come back again and hopefully for a longer period of time ! Highly recommanded !",5
Wonderful stay great location! This is my second stay at the hotel for my business and leisures travel. Each time is way better than the next! Houda Bouadya of guest relations is absolutely wonderful!  ,5
The air conditioning didn‚Äôt work. The front desk said open the window. The room was still very hot for sleeping. They advertise A/C in the brochure.  It turns out that coffee pods for the coffee maker in the room are only provided for the first night you must pay extra if you stay more than one night. This is after paying $US 360/ night.  Service was poor for breakfast but the choices and variety was great.  ,3
"The hotel is very impressive, with good size rooms and bath, and great storage. Very clean. Lovely lobby. Helpful staff. Excellent breakfast with great variety. Rooms built around a beautiful courtyard with gardens and a pool in one section of it.   The problems were specific to me, but I‚Äôm writing in case they might be applicable to readers. We visited in March, which is a shoulder season in terms of climate. Days are warm enough for shirtsleeves, but at night one needs a jacket. The hotel‚Äôs heating and air conditioning system allows for only heat OR A/C. The heat was on while we were there, which meant that the rooms were uncomfortably warm during the day and even at night they didn‚Äôt cool down unless one left the screenless windows open. There was no way to get the system to‚Ä¶",4
The Hotel was a great experience. The mattress was really comfortable and the cushions excellent. WiFi worked well throughout the Hotel.  The Food was well prepared and presented. Plenty of storage for clothes and Toiletries. The Housekeeping was good replacing used items from bathroom and capsules for Nespresso machine. Staff were helpful and friendly. Bath was huge and needed ages to fill.  I did not understand why it needed to be so deep. I enjoyed my visit.  I was part of a Tour Group and we all loved it.,5
"I have invited my parents to stay at the hotel, they were warmly welcomed and were offered a free upgrade and cake for their wedding anniversary. I definitely recommend this hotel for the impeccable service.",5
"La Tour - the good - a lovely facility in a great location close to the Medina and within walking distance of Chellah and other sites. Rooms are nice and staff is helpful. Wifi is excellent and free.  Breakfast buffet is very good. The marginal - air conditioning is a 2 pipe system meaning that you either have heat or a/c so that when we were there in February the hotel was in heat mode so the a/c blew only hot air requiring open windows most of the time. Not surprising for a hotel operating since 1914, but not 4 or 5 star either. Other details were missing like wash cloths, and coffee was sporadic as was bottled water. Unfortunately I have no experience with other hotels in Rabat to compare.",3
"I just spent 4 wonderful nights at this hotel..I was greeted by very friendly helpful staff and Houda, with her lovely smile and friendly attitude.   The spacious lobby smelled of roses. My room was large with a couch, 2 chairs,  small table, king bed, a safe,Samsung TV and beautiful marble bathroom...I visited the spa for hammam (scrubbing) and massage, a beautiful experience.   I had dinner once in the Moroccan restaurant (tagine of chicken and apricots--just delicious..two musicians played oud and drum..it was delightful...two nights I dined in the international restaurant,  perfectly prepared lamb chops on one night, duck the next. The wait staff was outstanding all 3 nights...a great thing about this hotel is its proximity to museum of art, soul and Hassan tower.  I walked‚Ä¶",5
"My first time in Morocco, and I was blown away with this beautiful palace hotel.  The spa was very relaxing, too bad it was too cold for pool.  The Moroccan restaurant had wonderful food, as well as the breakfast buffet.  The room was large, well appointed very comfortable.  Staff was friendly and helpful.",5
"I've stayed in La Tour Hassan last week and had a fabulous experience.  I was there for work with one of my colleagues and we booked the huge meeting room for the full day for an event of the company we work for.   When we arrived the 21st of January, Houda gave us a very warm welcome and showed us our rooms. We even received a free upgrade to a room with a garden view.  She showed us the meeting room together with one of the event coordinators. I was very impressed with Houda's fluency in English.   The event was very well arranged by the hotel staff and multiple times a day they asked us if we needed anything. So helpful!  The breakfast was amazing, fresh juices everyday!   10/10! We will definitely return to this beautiful hotel!",5
I am staying here on business trip for a few days. The Hotel is really nice. So far the service is very good. The fitness gym has all I need to keep up on my fitness regime. The Spa is excellent. I will definitely go again before I leave.,5
"Second time staying here,service staff, especially the front desk staff, was fantastic. Room was extra clean and well stocked. plenty of pillows and snacks in the room. The restaurants in the hotel are all worth trying and the best part is the short walk to the Medina. Everyone is very friendly and will go out of their way to assist . Will definitely stay here again",5
"I was there on business. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times, specially Ms. Houda Bouadya from guest relations, who ensured that everything was perfect right from check-in. The service was excellent and the food was equally good and the staff friendly and helpful. The hotel is centrally located and hence ease to attend business meetings as well as enjoying the sites of Rabat. Definitely worth a return visit, but this time for leisure.",5
"I received an excellent service, great greeting by the young lady at the service desk and a wonderful massage by souad.  Next time I come back to this hotel I will definitely have an other massage session and I highly recommend the spa services. Thank you very much ladies for your sens of high level service.",5
"I was there for business and the banquet staff was very attentive, helped us when we had questions or issues and was very hospitable. The hotel is beautiful. So much detail in everything about it. The food was great. The room is a little bit small but not to where it was an inconvenience or anything. The only bad thing is that to me, the weather was warm my first few days but the whole property is on a centralized heating/cooling system and to them, it was winter weather. So my room was a little hot the first couple of days until the weather did cool down. It's within walking distance of many great restaurants as well as the medina where you can do some fun souvenir shopping. It's also within walking distance to the beach and the Oudayas.",5
"The hotel was great and especially Ms.Houda Bouadya from guest  relations made my trip more special with her kind and caring treatment.   The rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet. Overall I am satisfied with my stay.",5
"A very amazing experience at Tour Hassan Hotel with warm welcomr, top quality services and very nice building in the heart of Rabat. I would definitely recommend this hotel especially for business travellers! ",5
"Excellent room (very big,comfortable bed and pillows),,great food( tasty and big portions),,friendly staff,location is good ,,room service is fair quick,WIFI very effiecient,the only thing that need to be revised is tv channels where they need to have arabic movies channel",5
"The hotel facilities were so amazing and variable. Also, the staff was so helpful and hospitable. Particularly, the way that their Guest Relation, Houda Bouadya, treated me was so commendable and professional. Eventually, if I am planning to visit Rabat again, La Tour Hassan Hotel will be the idealistic place to stay in.",5
"I was on a business trip and colleagues made this booking for me. Great location and impressive decor. Don't miss an opportunity to dine in the national restaurant. The staff was very kind and very helpful with information about getting around Rabat, especially Ms. Houda, from the guest relations. Definitely recommending this hotel.",5
"This month, my wife and I took a vacation to Morocco and our first stop was La Tour Hassan Palace hotel in Rabat.This hotel is located in the center of town and its staff gave us a great welcome. The room was cleaned more than once a day with fresh linen and bottles of water. The reception area was furnished well and its gardens were groomed quite frequently. The hotel has three restaurants and each one offered and served specialty food for every taste. Their customer services were exceptionally professional and friendly. The concierge Ms. Houda Bouadya was a great resource, always available and ready with a recommendation and destination. This hotel gave us a great first experience for our vacation to Morocco. We strongly recommend this hotel when visiting Rabat. DB New York‚Ä¶",5
