" great night. The hotel is nice , thank you All staff of the bar and reception specially mouhamed , delicious food , excellent service .The ambiance is very charming also staff is very professional ,I highly   recommend a visit..............",5
I stayed one night and wish I'd stayed longer.  The rooms were comfortable and the staff was amazing with pandemic protocol in place.  Staff wore masks everywhere and breakfast was made to order.  My omelette was cooked to absolute perfection and the pastries were delicious.  There was so much food that I asked if I could take it with me and they gave me a box with extra pastries!  The pool is beautiful and was heated.  I highly recommend and would definitely stay here again!,5
"If i want to talk about story so i need to tell a story, i will start from the location it based in alswisi which is in the most beautiful part of the rabat so quite and so clean, the rooms are very spacious well decorated with balcony, they have a very nice terrace and Restarunt the staff is so friendly, and for sure o will come back again and again.",5
"Excellent hotel in the embassy district about fifteen minutes drive from the center. The rooms, modern in style and very large, are spotless and upon arrival a welcome kit with sweets and local fruit is provided. The hotel is a jewel from an artistic point of view, with paintings and author's objects, a library, conference room, swimming pool, solarium, gym. The staff is very kind and very helpful to satisfy every request. Given the distance from the center, it is necessary to have a car available for travel.",5
"Everything was great during my stay at this hotel, professional staff specially the guest manager Rim. Cleanliness and food quality was also top notch, definitely recommend this as the best hotel in Rabat",5
I stayed at Story rabat for 2 days and 1 nights. The attenders were very keen to us. The food we had was really great. Whenever I visit rabat for vacation. I will definitely stay at Rabat hotels for sure.,5
"Perfect and luxurious ambiance, soothing to the eyes, which will surely make anyone feel relaxed. All staff are very accommodating and courteous, and would always make sure that all of the guests' needs are provided with high satisfaction. Foods are presented elegantly and of course, flavourful and delectable.   This place is highly recommended for anyone who will be visiting Morocco.",5
"I stayed 5 days and 4 nights at Villa Diyafa with my fiancé. It was just amazing, the food was great and not really expensive, the chef is great and present nice menus.  The rooms are really comfortable, and spacious. The  personnel is really gentle and at your every needs.  The director is also really engaged in the well being of his guests, we had a question, and we were able to walk in his office and he welcomed us and helped us immediately. The hotel is in the embassy neighborhood, which is really calm and beautiful.  I definitely recommend this hotel ! I already did it to all my colleagues !  Thanks again for this amazing stay and see you in 2020 :)",5
"I stayed in Villa Diyafa and I can clearly say that it was one of my best stays ever. The interior was beautiful, the service was outstanding and the food was delicious. The staffs were friendly and helpful but the butler Houssam was one of a kind. He made sure that our stay was smooth and brilliant, and went out of his way to assist us for everything which made us feel very welcomes and comfortable. He is an asset to the property and for that we are thankful for his services. ",5
"The hotel is nice but the service is the worst ever. Nobody from the staff is around, nobody at reception, no bell-boy, concierge or a manager! The food is terrible, breakfast is worst, room service takes hours to get to the room, etc. Never come back.",3
"They cancelled my reservation two days before my stay leaving us without a place to stay in a foreign country. We had made the reservation two months in advance and all they did was to send a curt email saying that they will cancel because of ""local impediments"" and that we should reach out for further details and assistance. No solution / alternatives were provided which is really a terrible form. When I called they said that the general manager is ""very busy"" then that he was not there and that they couldn't accommodate us in another room because they were fully booked, even though there were other rooms available according to other booking sites. Not sure what to believe what they are saying anymore but they clearly don't care. Very poor experience and I will never look to…",1
"They were overbooked when I arrived, and said that their reservation system had been experiencing technical problems.  I showed them the reservation on my computer right on their own website... but all the rooms were full and it didn’t matter.  Said they reported the problem to IT.  If you book with this hotel make sure you speak to them on the phone and confirm your arrangements—don’t trust their own website.  They also never reply to emails at their reservation email address, which is very poor for a hotel of this supposed quality.  I’d have given them only 1 star but for the fact that they were friendly, helped me get a roo m at a different hotel, and paid for the cost of the taxi to get there. I appreciate all that but there’s just no excuse for a broken reservation system…",2
"Having done the rounds of  pricey hammams here in rabat, hands down the winner is villa diyafa. They definitely give you your money s worth! Excellent welcome and reception . Beautiful, discreet  and serene surroundings . Malika , the lady who did the hammam was very skilled , professional and did everything with excellence and integrity. All too often you will have spas here state they are five stars institutions and you end up having something done too hastily or in a sloppy manner : you tend to walk out feeling shortchanged .... I highly highly recommend villa diyafa ! Great experience , thank you !",5
"There are many positive things about this hotel and a few drawbacks to consider, so I will review it as a good vs bad comparison:  The Good:  -Rooms are ample to say the least, consisting on a bedroom, a living room, a nice sized Terrazas and a very ample bathroom and walk in closet. -The hotel grounds are nice and inviting with lots of garden furniture and relaxation spots. Hotel is of a modern well keep look -Beds are comfortable   The Bad: -Pool temperatura is quite cold, which, during the hottest months might be appreciated but otherwise you won’t. -The room shower has a terrible defect which floods most of the bathroom. -our rom in particular lacked a hair dryer and cups for the coffee machine. -Breakfast preparation will be slow and very limited, ( mostly croissants,…",4
"The room was spectacular . The beds d linens luxurious . On the negative side -the staff is almost nonexistent . When we returned back from dinnert ( both evenings )there was no one behind the front desk and no staff anywhere  at all . Breakfast was totally disorganized. We were told there was on,y one breakfast menu for the entire restaurant. Only one waiter . The food was awful. The first day I ordered a egg white omelet and I got scrambled something in a plate full of liquid .  The food is brought in no specific order but not together . Our friend ordered eggs with smoked salmon and halal bacon.  They had neither. He ordered hash brown potatoes. They brought outroasted potatoes after we had finished our meal .  Breakfast on the second day was a bit better organized but we…",4
"The hotel was extremely well taken care of, the room was perfect in every way, the best bathroom I have ever had in a hotel, as well as a very comfortable bed. The staff was very nice, helped us with providing a driver and guide. Also we chose to have a car from the hotel pick us up from the airport- and was one of the best 500 MAD I’ve ever spent! Thank you Villla Diyafa. ",5
"We spent one evening in a Suite.  It was exceptional.  The beds and linens were luxurious as was the washroom.  The property was beautifully landscaped and incredibly quiet.  As well, the food at the restaurants was also great.",5
"We just overnighted at this hotel as we were enroute from Casa to Fes.  Standard suite was spacious, plush, and impeccably furnished.   The grounds were just beautiful and so relaxing.  Too bad we did not have more time to enjoy the services as we arrived late afternoon and left first thing in the morning.  Definitely a go to spot to overnight or stay longer.  Dinner was also top rate.",5
"I've traveled to more than 100 counties over the last 40 years, few hotels can match the combined comfort, elegance and service levels you'll find at Villa Diyafa. Rooms spacious and well-appointed. Food excellent. The staff was world class, especially our butler Abdelali.",5
"Stayed here one night while traveling down the coast of Morroco to Las Palmas for the Arc yacht race, often stay in hotels to mix it up a tad from the boat.   If your the type of person that likes Four Seasons One and Only etc etc......this is the place for you, don’t even bother looking elsewhere this is by far the best hotel in Rabat.  Hotel is Utter class, suites are beautiful,food,staff,interior design all perfect. Just One thing........get the hotel car to pick you up........don’t get a taxi ! They have know idea where it is, and it’s a complete head f**** trying to explain it after a long journey, it’s 300DHM well spent! Great hotel and amazing staff running it, you won’t fault it.",5
"Without doubts this is the best and most luxurious hotel in Rabat. Boutique hotel with outstanding discrete service, superb gastronomy, nice outside pool and nice massages in the spa. 80sqm suites (all rooms are suites) plus terrace. Top Moroccan guests and visitors in the restaurant at lunch time. Intimate, private, discreet. Just perfect, really enjoyed my 3 days stay. Will repeat next time.",5
"At the entrance to the property we were greeted with a finely appointed property.  The artwork, the spacious rooms, the detail in the decorating were all of the highest caliber.  We had a Moroccan dinner in the garden area and with the night lighting it all felt very serene and elegant.  The meal was far more than we expected in terms of quantity and flavour. The tagines were excellent but one would have been enough for us to share with all the extras that were given to us.  The freshness of the ingredients was apparent in the flavours.......so delicious!!!  No liquor is on the menu at the restaurant however one can order a drink at the bar. Breakfast was the same.  We ordered a breakfast tagine and an omelette but with all the pastries, fruit, and cheeses, we had far too much…",5
"everything from start to finish was simply perfect at this stunning hotel....from the gracious welcome, beautifully appointed suite, service, meal EVERYTHING....simply amazing and can't wait to go back one day !!",5
"Abundance of everything lovely in a perfect setting. How terrible it was to leave; the water garden, the swimming pool, the Menu de Soins Spa, the stunning restaurant and  food, the magnificent suite.  The welcome enhanced with the delicious gift of fruit. We lived for a moment in the very warm embrace of Morocco, our heartfelt thanks to the Vila Diyafa and the sublime professional hotel team.  Mr Abdelali was as our personal assistant, always willing and ready to hear everything we needed or requested, including a driver for an evening, was provided with enormous style and grace. We were driven in a luxury car and wholly treated during our too short stay with total regard to our comfort.",5
"The suites are beautiful and super comfortable. The hotel is of very high standards with great interior design. The garden is magical and the smell of orange blossom mesmerizing. And what make this charming place even better is the professional service all around. From the friendly receptionists, butlers and driver to the very skilled bartender mixologists and professional restaurant staff.  I was lucky to spend a few nights in villa Diyafa, and can only recommend it to all. Will come again. Thank you!",5
"This is the real definition of being a guest. Simply and warmly welcomed by all the entire team. Professional skills from all friendly staff during my whole stay. Efficient, discret and professionals. The Villa is very well maintained and properly designed with good taste. Suites are extremely nice, moderns, and warm. Surprising facilities as an amazing spa, gym, private conference room… All the necessary to enjoy your stay and this villa becomes a magnifique boutique hotel. On top of that, visiting Rabat was fantastic, driver from the villa with private visit in luxury car, amazing lunch in Dinarjat thanks to Wahfi for this unforgetable moment, and beautiful tour of Kazbha Oudayas!  It’s a real « no fault » as exceptionnal as it is. A very nice place for business purposes, but…",5
"This was a pleasant surprise—we wish we could have stayed more than 1 night, especially to spend time in the gardens. Our room was wonderful, the service was excellent. We had an excellent dinner in the restaurant . The only negative was that there was smoking in both the bar and lounge area outside the restaurant.",5
We loved it here. Beautiful fairly new property with HUGE rooms and wonderful bathrooms and amenities. Would definitely come back. There is smoking in bar and restaurant--seems this is the norm in morocco,5
"Without any doubt its the best place to be in Rabat!!  A cosy, luxurious and beautiful boutique hotel with a very professional and nice staff I also recommend the SPA as it is definitely the best in Rabat. Great experience and very warm people!  thank you for this unforgettable moments!",5
"This is one of the most beautiful hotels we have ever stayed in (and we travel a lot!). The rooms are fabulous - enormous suites with high ceilings, beautifully appointed sitting areas and bathrooms which are just superb. The common areas are also splendidly furnished in a modern but very comfortable way which subtly complements Moroccan style and culture. Most importantly, the staff are very friendly and efficient. The manager was also highly visible and present which is always so important in a top tier hotel.  We used hotel cars for some excursions which we found to be a very good way to get around. The cars were excellent and the drivers very professional. We ate at the hotel restaurant twice for dinner and really enjoyed the menu options - Moroccan dishes as well as very…",5
I consider it as one of the best in rabat ..cosy place staff are great..peaceful  and amazing rooms all are suites style.staff are very helpful..highly recommended when in rabat .  Also gym .pool and lovely spa included in a very nice neighbourhood. ,4
"Without a doubt the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Every detail from check-in to my departure was exceptional. Upon arrival, I was warmly welcomed by the staff and the general manager Mr. Harry. The hotel is amazing. Rooms were very spacious with excellent design.The garden and the swimming pool will be the best you will ever see. The feeling of relaxation you get when you sit there it's something unique.The level of service and overall guest experience was exceptional - I've been raving about it to all of my friends and family. Thank you for a stay that was memorable and one of the most enjoyable I've ever had.  All respect for the staff and especially the GM Mr. Harry who does a great job here; a true sample of excellent and luxurious hospitality!  Finally my congrats to the…",5
"We visited this hotel for a drink and to book the hammam  & massage. They showed us around and served our drinks. The propriety is beautiful clean and calm. However the reservation service is unreliable and one big mess. We booked the spa and left the hotel to later receive a call saying that the hammam doesn't work on our date and we could only have a massage. So we had to re-arrange our plans and booked the hammam & massage on another day. Once again we had another day perfectly planned until again we got a call from the hotel saying that they messed up the reservation and our time slot was already taken. We tried to say that it was our last day in Rabat and we would appreciate they could find a way to book us in, which they couldn't. That's a shame for a 5 star small…",2
The massage was great and relaxing and the masseuse was extremely good.. it simply blow my mind. actualy not only the massage I would recommend the whole journey nice place to chill and relax this place is amazing,5
"My fiance and I had a busy travel schedule, we've been more on the road than staying and relaxing until we reach our final destination Rabat. We've been recommended the place by a friend who stayed before and believe me, it's beyond expectations. From the arrival warm welcome of the management team to the last moment in the hotel, we've been  pampered in the most effecient and professional ways. The butler service made our stay feels like royalty, from organising our stay in terms of dinning and activities to our smooth departure. To sum up, if you are looking for a relaxing place where everything will be taken care of by a personal butler, I highly recommend you this place.",5
Have a three night stay here and this is a place which is really easy on the eyes and nerves! Family welcome Suites spacious clean and only 10 of them. First class service and professionally headed by Harry. Air conditioning works and the bathroom facilities really state of the art High speed internet and great atmosphere ,5
From the welcome by the manager to the room to the pool to the dining.  It was as good as it gets.   I'm trying to figure out how I can get back to Rabat so that I can stay a little longer and check out the spa.....and just luxuriate a little more.,5
"Villa Diyafa is an excellent 5 stars hotel, which i can warmly recomand. The hotel was provide excellent five star service with five star staff. and it is in very good condition. As soon as we arrieved on the hotel we met one Mr Houssam , this is a person who was 24 hours a day available for us. He was a very very nice guy and took very good care of our stay. The food was very good and diversified and the service was excellent. The chefs and the waiters were always doing their best to satisfy any wish of the guest.",5
"Mr. Harry Leitner and his friendly staff can't do enough to ensure that your visit is a memorable one.  This villa is located in a quiet area of Rabat and truly exemplifies the classification of a boutique hotel.  Having spent some 24 hours traveling (including some touring in Casablanca), the hotel was the perfect place to unwind and enjoy a great dinner and a wonderful accommodation.  Even being here at the start of Ramadan, the hotel was well prepared to handle its guests and to insure that all your needs were efficiently and graciously handled.",5
"After a 7-hour flight to Casablanca and then a tour of the Hassan II Mosque, we arrived at Villa Diyafa -- a perfect place to acclimate in Morocco.  The staff is friendly and very pro-active, almost knowing what we wanted before we even knew what we wanted.  We will definitely stay there again on our next journey to Morocco.",5
"Have never been to Rabat before, but staying at Villa Diyafa may make me want come again.  This boutique hotel is just beautiful.  Our room is lovely - large, spacious, perfectly decorated.  Just love it. Lorraine at the spa gave me a wonderful and unique massage - which was excellent.  Have not gone into the pool as it is still a bit cool - but is so exquisite may have to at least try.  However, the best part of this gem are the wonderful host and staff.  We were greeted and given a tour right after our mocktail. Our host, Harry, was part of the greeting committee.  After a long day flying - we felt so very comfortable.  Harry and his staff were perfect.  Perfectly professional but also perfectly friendly - what a skill.  We had dinner in their restaurant and was wonderful. …",5
"We spent two magical nights in this gem, ideally situated in a very quite area. We had a lovely, well equiped suite: very spacious (about 80m2), at the edge of latest technology, decorated with taste and well maintened. The food is great, and the service personalized. Very large pool to enjoy (semi-olympic) and amazing garden to chill at. Great staff: nothing is too much to make you feel you are staying at a Relais & Chateaux property. The Spa experience is not to be missed, especially the Hammam!! The city offers several sites to visit (Chellah, Oudayas, Museums, the Marina), and two days is almost not enough to see all of it. The historical golf of Dar Essalam is only 5 min drives from the property. Thank you to the whole staff for this great experience. We will definitly be…",5
"We enjoyed a terrific stay at this beautiful boutique hotel with every amenity, delicious food, fantastic personalized service and terrific surroundings.  The general manager and his wife did everything to make our stay special.  ",5
"Top notch in every way--décor, location, service--a destination of its own to enjoy. The hotel's restaurant had the best food we encountered in Morocco. For those on business trips this would be a fantastic place to spend a week.",5
"We arrived at the property at 10:00 PM after a long day's travel. The check in staff, as well as the restaurant staff, were very accommodating, staying open late to serve us, as well as accommodating the vegetarian with a expertly prepared pasta dish. There was interest in the olive oil, and then the staff proceeded, despite the hour to prepare a small tasting dish, taking the time to explain the subtleties of the oil.  The room was spacious and well appointed, with very comfortable bed and linens. The fitness centre seemed well equipped, while the spa appeared to be inviting. Harry and his colleagues are wonderful hosts-you will be glad you stayed with them",5
"Perfect service and friendliness. Boutique hotel with only 10 suites. Exquisite architecture, landscaping, suites, and dining. One of best hotels in the world.  Manager and staff went out of way to make us feel welcome. ",5
"This is a very special hotel in Rabat.  A little off the beaten trail but worth the extra effort to get there.  It's peace and quiet in a busy place.  The rooms are beyond amazing and service goes right along with it.  Harry, the GM is hands on to make sure your visit is the best.",5
"What a gem of a hotel!  Loved everything about this place.  It is a boutique hotel- 10 suites and 1 villa- that is beautifully appointed.  Rooms are gorgeous and comfortable...the public areas are vibrant, plush and cozy.  Food was superb and the service was stellar.  Can't say enough about this little hidden gem.  Definitely recommend it!",5
"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Villa Diyafa, and it did not disappoint. This wonderful little property has been beautifully designed and appointed and any guest would immediately feel wrapped in it's beauty. From the lovely gardens, the subtle smells, delicious food, and wonderful designs with carefully thought out details, it really is a special little place. Well worth visiting, and very hard to leave.",5
"Fabulous place and incredible hotel, the staff perfect, the director very friendly with us, we did stay for three days same than paradise, relax, best food, and very quiet place, I hope will repeat another time. ",5
"What a beautiful hotel!!  Our room had a living room, a bedroom and a huge bathroom.  The owner was so friendly and everyone did their best to make us feel welcome. I would go to Rabat again just to stay in this wonderful hotel. We have stayed in many nice hotels and this hotel was every bit as nice as any.  Our dinner in their restaurant was one of the best on our trip. Don't miss this hotel!!",5
"There are many kinds of luxuries in the world, but well seasoned travelers also know that those luxuries tend to become more and more similiar, from Taipei to Tahiti. The homogenising corporate influence is as present in the rarefied world of luxury as everywhere else. So what an absolute delight to wander into the Villa Diyafa hotel in Rabat, run by an enchanting Swiss couple with Swiss savoir-faire and a sense of old Europe coziness, but entirely staffed by Moroccans with their own profound sense of grace and hospitality. Especially given the somewhat tawdry and arid character of the city, this hotel is a true oasis of human warmth, high end pampering and old fashioned luxury in a more modern context. With only 20 or so suites, intimacy and privacy can be maintained at perfect…",5
"The service provided was excellent, absolutely nothing to criticise or complain about.  Staff were attentive, yet discreet.  Personal choices were accommodated for at all times.  Staff communicated well in English, with no translation problems which is unique for this area.    The suite was fantastic and well thought out regarding the layout.  Loved that I could Bluetooth my music around my suite, with high quality sound. Lovely area to walk around and explore, with a great walk down to the golf course from the hotel.",5
We were very impressed by the luxurious suites in the hotel especially the bathroom. Every attention to detail has been paid and the bedding is amazing - we had the best nights sleep here! We particularly enjoyed using the residents lounge which has been extremely tastefully designed. We travel a lot with our business but this has to be one of the best hotels we have stayed in.,5
"Don't think that because you have a reservation here, you actually have a reservation!  We had reserved a room through Abercrombie & Kent and were very much looking forward to staying here on the evening of December 28, 2015 based on Trip Advisor reviews and the A&K recommendation. Our trip was to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and my 60th birthday so it was very important to us that things go smoothly. We had been in transit for some 30 hours, starting in Los Angeles and then changing planes in Geneva. The flight from LA to Newark had moderate to severe turbulence which had been quite frightening and exhausting.  All of which is to say that when we landed in Marrakech we were looking forward with great anticipation to the pool and spa at Villa Diyafa Boutique Hotel and…",1
"The Villa Diyafa has lovely large suites.  The property is also well designed with compelling decor.  We were very impressed  by the service.  Thoroughly enjoyed experiencing the hamman and exfoliation treatment.  Location is a ways out of downtown Rabat, in the embassy district.  Not much to walk to but a short car ride from the sights.",5
"We arrived at Villa Diyafa in the late afternoon, a little tired. But we were energized immediately by the welcome we received. The manager greeted us and introduced us to our personal butler who was gentlemanly and deferential. While our luggage was carried to our room, our butler led us to room 18, and we were dazzled by the elegance, style, and size of our accommodations. We had floor to ceiling glass in both the bedroom and living room, with a view of a beautiful pool  and gardens. A spa was available for our use and dinner that night was outstanding, both in taste and service. Villa Diyafa is on Embassy Row, but you don't have to be an  Ambassador or a Prince to be treated like one.",5
"The hotel it's awesome, nice and very special place, the staff is very friendly, the food it's for your senses, Mr. Harry the director's is very friendly, thanks for everything to the hotel and the staff. I hope stay here another week with family or friends.  ",5
"I was lucky enough to have had the opportunity to stay at Villa Diyafa for just over 3 weeks, for work. Immediately upon arrival, I was greeted from the car and shown straight to my room. My butler gave me a thorough introduction to the room with great attention to detail. I was also guided around the hotel facilities.   The room was stunningly styled with a modern Moroccan inspiration and beautiful pieces of art, though the main luxury is the exceedingly comfortable bed! Each room also extends onto a small courtyard area outside. I was on the ground floor, so this area backed onto the perfectly manicured garden and view of the restaurant and pool. The place certainly makes you feel like you have your own small studio apartment- minus the kitchen.   The butlers were…",5
"Exceptional quality of a hotel. Warm reception very high end quality room.very good service .the breakfast area is amazing ,a lot of  fresh local food ,with amazing service .you just need to try it to discover the truth truth .good value for money .",5
"Villa Diyafa is an almost perfect hotel. Located in the quiet embassy district, it caters largely to business travellers visiting Morocco's capital and has all the modern touches and conveniences you could imagine. It is also a perfect place for a relaxing break.  I hope your trip allows you time to enjoy the wonderful pool and spa, but even if you only have time for the delicious restaurant and sleeping in your exceedingly comfortable bed, you'll love Villa Diyafa.",5
"I stayed for few days in Villa Diyafa. The privacy, facilities, rooms, and cheft(!) make this hotel one of a kind. The pool and the cozy gym are great. The chef is amazing and the food is fresh! The staff is very friendly and hotel manager is meticulous. Overall, one of the best hotels ive ever been to. ",5
"During the visit to Villa Diyafa in February, though we did not have a booking, the staff were attentive and professional and most notably they remembered me by name from previous visits. This made the experience really memorable for us. Having been to Villa Diyafa a few times, the welcoming exclusive feeling seems to be one of the hotel’s most unique features.   As walk in guests, we were offered a welcome drink and a light breakfast while a suite was prepared. When we got our suite, I was impressed by the attention to detail - our butler had prepared the fruit and room scent selection as per my last visit to the hotel. The suite we had was on first floor with a terrace overlooking the garden. It was beautifully designed with bespoke furniture and provided great space to relax,…",4
"A beautiful and memorable stay which I had from 10th March - 13th March in Villa Diyafa. A small but very trendy hotel, contemporary design, cozy and private atmosphere.  Staff are so well trained, they are welcoming, respectful and discreet hospitality service was truly impressive from all levels of staff and the top management.  High tech of electronic lighting, music and heating system was a great eye opening.   The management is paying so much attention to the details. Excellent bathroom amenities, high quantity tissue paper and bed linens. Delicious turn down amenities and cute little luggage bench for your hand bag in the restaurant, magnificent  Moroccan cuisine and excellent Spa service!   Will certainly come back again!",5
"I was recommended to this hotel by a business contact. A very new small business hotel in a lovely residential area of Rabat. I was impressed about this small but very wonderful quality hotel. Great service, Great staff and a great location. They have a lovely Spa with great attendants too and a huge pool. I loved this place and plan to return this summer.",5
"We stayed there for one week and it was heaven. The personnel was very friendly and helpful all the time, the rooms are big, affectionately furnished and very well equipped. The Spa was also very nice. But what we liked most was the privacy of this little boutique hotel. During our next trip to rabat, we are going to stay there for sure!",5
"Only 10  large, very comfortable suites with high ceilings. Enjoyed the Library with honour bar and fire place. Restaurant and bar attracts the local community (ambassadors, business people, GCC investors, etc.). Beautiful!",5
